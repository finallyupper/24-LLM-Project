Question: What is the term for interpretations of quantum mechanics that assign definite properties to quantum systems even when they are not being measured?
Answer:Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics are those that assign definite properties to quantum systems even when they are not being measured.
### Category: meinong
Question: How does Meinong define what a word means according to his fragmentary philosophical views on language?
Answer:According to Meinong's fragmentary philosophical views on language, a word means something insofar as it expresses a presenting experience, and the object thereby presented is the meaning. This generalizes to all linguistic items, where if someone judges a sentence, she expresses a judgment and its presupposed representations, and she means the objective that is being judged.
### Category: self-deception
Question: What is an example of twisted self-deception as described by the literature?
Answer:An example of twisted self-deception is a jealous husband who comes to believe on weak evidence that his wife is having an affair, something he doesn't want to be true, in ways similar to how ordinary self-deceivers come to believe something they want to be true despite strong evidence to the contrary.
### Category: james-viterbo
Question: What does James argue relations to be in a less proper way of speaking?
Answer:In a less proper way of speaking, James argues that relations are things, but in an absolute sense, they are not. Instead, he suggests that relations are modes of being of their foundations.
### Category: scientific-discovery
Question: What is the significance of neutral analogies in Hesse's approach to models and analogies in theory construction and development?
Answer:Neutral analogies in Hesse's approach are the most significant because they represent properties of the model about which we do not know whether they apply to the target domain. These properties might lead to new insights about the less familiar domain and potentially result in new predictions that can be tested. Neutral analogies are crucial in scientific discovery as they open up possibilities for expanding our understanding of unfamiliar domains by drawing on what is well-established in more familiar domains through analogy.
### Category: jefferson
Question: What was Jefferson's goal in implementing republican governing?
Answer:Jefferson's goal in implementing republican governing was to impose the minimal political structure needed to maximize human liberty, free human potentiality, and ensure the political ascendency of the talented and virtuous, not the wealthy and wellborn.
### Category: richard-price
Question: What special relationship does a promisor have with the individual to whom a promise is made that is not shared with others who might overhear or be otherwise aware of the promise?
Answer:The promisor has a special relationship with the individual to whom a promise is made in that they have directly committed to fulfilling a specific request or action for that individual, whereas others who are aware of the promise only have reason to believe that the promisor will fulfill their commitment, but do not have the same claim on the promisor's actions. This special relationship grants certain privileges and obligations to the promisee, such as the ability to hold the promisor accountable for fulfilling the promise and the power to release the promisor from their commitment
### Category: organs-sale
Question: What measures do Erin and Harris suggest to protect both organ donors and recipients when organ sales are legalized?
Answer:Erin and Harris propose building in practical protections such as adequate medical care and thorough health checkups before donation takes place to protect both organ donors and recipients when organ sales are legalized.
### Category: song-ming-confucianism
Question: What historical context influenced the political thinkers in the Southern Song period regarding their views on governance and character?
Answer:The political thinkers in the Southern Song period were influenced by the Northern Song's failed reform attempts, disastrous famine leading to widespread debt and dislocation, and ultimately falling to Jurchen invaders. This background led them to blame the attempt at improving governance through mere reform (rather than character improvement) for the Northern Song's downfall, making them attracted to Xunzi's position on people (of good character) versus institutional rules. Zhu Xi articulated this consensus position in his remarks to his students.
### Category: einstein-philscience
Question: What does Einstein's argument imply about the designation of certain elements as a priori?
Answer:Einstein's argument implies that there is no principle that determines which elements can be designated as a priori and that our ability to designate them as such derives from the fact that it is only the totality of the elements that possesses empirical content.
### Category: nonexistent-objects
Question: What is the Meinongian view on the existence of objects like 'the object blue' or 'the object round'?
Answer:According to the Meinongian view, such objects do not exist; rather, they are non-existent and even necessarily non-existent. These objects are incomplete or incompletely determined as they lack the complete determination found in existing objects. Each existing object has infinitely many properties and is completely determined in contrast to incomplete objects.
### Category: beauvoir
Question: What does Beauvoir argue is the consequence of privileging the future over the present?
Answer:Beauvoir argues that privileging the future over the present leads to sacrificing the present for the future, and can result in inquisitions, imperialisms, gulags, and even places like Auschwitz. It perverts our relationship with time, each other, and ourselves, but by insisting on the dignity of today's human beings, we can secure the dignity of those to come.
### Category: phylogenetic-inference
Question: What kind of advancement in phylogenetic inference is represented by Pease et al.'s (2016) reconstruction of the tomato clade using new tools?
Answer:Pease et al.'s (2016) reconstruction of the tomato clade represents an advancement in the level of resolution phylogeneticists are able to reconstruct and identify by recognizing specific patterns of discordance in what was previously treated as noise.
### Category: truthlikeness
Question: What issue arises when attempting to identify relevant consequences as basic ones using atomic sentences or their negations in the \(h\)-\(r\)-\(w\) framework?
Answer:The issue is that many distinct propositions imply the same atomic sentences, so this criterion would not satisfy the requirement that \(A\) be equivalent to \(A_R\). For instance, (\(h\vee r\)) and (\({\sim}h\vee{\sim}r\)), like tautologies, imply no atomic sentences at all.
### Category: belief-merging
Question: What is the purpose of integrity constraints in the context of merging multiple belief bases?
Answer:Integrity constraints represent extra conditions that should follow from the merged bases to ensure that the aggregated information satisfies some problem-specific requirements. They can represent restrictions on available resources, as well as constraints on the coexistence of different projects. For example, they might prevent building incompatible structures such as a parking lot and a playground in the same area while allowing other combinations like a playground and a public library. The result of merging the multi-set E of belief bases given IC is a consistent belief base representing the collective beliefs and implying IC.
### Category: logic-conditionals
Question: What kind of models provide an explanation of the necessity involved in conditionals where the antecedent makes its consequent necessary in some sense?
Answer:Possible-worlds models provide an explanation of the necessity involved in conditionals where the antecedent makes its consequent necessary in some sense.
### Category: friedrich-jacobi
Question: What was Jacobi's proposed solution for dealing with the irrational results of philosophizing?
Answer:Jacobi proposed knowing when to stop philosophizing as the solution for dealing with the irrational results of philosophizing.
### Category: hume-newton
Question: What three areas of Hume's philosophical position does the quote provide insight into?
Answer:The quote reveals crucial details about Hume’s position in three areas: a) Hume’s understanding of the relative merits of Newton’s philosophy and the mechanical philosophy of Boyle; b) Hume’s attitude toward criteria of intelligibility; c) Hume’s skepticism.
### Category: platonism
Question: What is the view that number talk is about actual piles of physical objects rather than properties of piles called?
Answer:This view is called "Arithmetic is just a very general natural science" or sometimes "Physicalist Thesis about Numbers". It was developed by Mill (1843) and defended by Philip Kitcher (1984).
### Category: montague-semantics
Question: In what academic field did Richard Montague believe natural language belonged, based on his view of it as a formal language?
Answer:Richard Montague believed that natural language belonged to the academic field of mathematics, based on his view of it as a formal language.
### Category: events
Question: What is the view that events and facts are closely linked, often leading to their conception as the same entity called?
Answer:The view that events and facts are closely linked, often leading to their conception as the same entity, is called event-fact monism. This view is supported by some philosophers who believe that facts corresponding to non-equivalent propositions are distinct and that linguistic expressions of facts are semantically transparent.
### Category: epistemology-naturalized
Question: What would be the consequence of epistemology abandoning its business of justification, according to Kim (1988)?
Answer:According to Kim (1988), if epistemology were to abandon its business of justification, it would be going out of business, as it would no longer be addressing its central concerns.
### Category: morality-biology
Question: How does haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera contribute to the evolution of biological altruism in worker bees?
Answer:Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera means that sisters are more closely related to each other genetically than they would be to their own offspring. As a result, natural selection favors worker traits that help their mother reproduce, making more sisters who are especially likely to carry copies of the gene for that same trait. This can explain how worker sterility evolved and how even suicidal behavior could have been selected for as propagating the genes that cause it.
### Category: realism
Question: What is the verb used in the sentence when an action of reaching a decision or a judgment based on available evidence is implied?
Answer:The verb used in the sentence is "conclude"
### Category: simulations-science
Question: What did Winsberg argue regarding Frigg and Reiss's claim that computer simulation cannot raise new epistemological issues?
Answer:Winsberg argued that it was the simultaneous confluence of all three features (being based on a model, being stochastic, and involving a computational solution) that was new to simulation, and therefore could raise new epistemological issues.
### Category: well-being
Question: Why is it more appropriate to use the term 'well-being' instead of 'happiness' when discussing what makes life good for an individual?
Answer:It is more appropriate to use 'well-being' instead of 'happiness' because 'well-being' allows for the possibility that non-human beings, such as plants, can also have good lives, whereas 'happiness' implies consciousness and is typically restricted to human beings. The Greek term 'eudaimonia', often translated as 'happiness', is similarly limited in scope, being applied mainly to human beings due to its connotations of divine favor.
### Category: normativity-metaethics
Question: What might make a fact "queer" according to Olson's view on parsimony in theory building?
Answer:A fact may be considered "queer" if including it in a theory would result in a lack of parsimony, according to Olson's view.
### Category: empiricism-ancient-medieval
Question: What kind of methods for discovering causal relations were outlined by Scotus, and what was the general idea behind those methods?
Answer:Scotus outlined methods for discovering causal relations that involved separating out possible causes and testing them by seeing in which cases the effect follows. The general idea behind these methods was to isolate particular causes in order to discover causal connections, which was a new emphasis in this period of empiricism (Vos 2006: 312-19).
### Category: contract-law
Question: Why might it be puzzling, from the perspective of a harm-based view, when a party is still held liable for a breach of contract even when the promisee did not rely on the truth of the warranted information?
Answer:It might be puzzling because, from a harm-based view, holding a party liable for breach of contract is typically justified by the harm caused by the breach. If the promisee did not rely on the truth of the warranted information, then it might seem that there is no harm (or less harm) caused by the breach, which could make it unclear why the law would still hold the party liable. This is not a straightforward implication of a harm-based view, which is why it might be considered puzzling from this perspective.
### Category: practical-reason
Question: How is theoretical reflection often characterized in terms of its forward and backward gaze?
Answer:Theoretical reflection is often characterized as involving a gaze that looks backward to explain events that have already taken place, and looks forward to predict what will happen in the future.
### Category: legal-probabilism
Question: What is the probability threshold for establishing a version of facts in civil disputes under the preponderance of evidence standard?
Answer:The probability threshold for establishing a version of facts in civil disputes under the preponderance of evidence standard is greater than 0.5.
### Category: zhu-xi
Question: What is the analogy being drawn between the process of scientific discovery and what activity?
Answer:The process of scientific discovery is being compared to the act of puzzle-solving. This is because both involve trying out different hypotheses or possibilities until the right one is found.
### Category: skeptical-theism
Question: What must the skeptical theist add according to the given information in order for certain statements about lack of reason for thinking the sample is representative to be applicable to the noseeum inference?
Answer:The skeptical theist needs to add a lemma stating that we have no reason to think that the cases we do not see (noseeums) are not representative of reality. This lemma would allow for the previous statements to be applicable in the context of noseeum inferences.
### Category: states-of-affairs
Question: What does Russell seem to reject in his statement regarding propositions and facts?
Answer:Russell seems to reject the idea that there exist propositions in addition to facts, suggesting that the statement "that today is Wednesday" is not a separate thing from the fact that it is actually Tuesday.
### Category: ethics-indian-buddhism
Question: Why might Buddhist societies be reluctant to prohibit abortion despite believing it is morally wrong?
Answer:Buddhist societies might be reluctant to prohibit abortion due to their historical advocacy of religious toleration, the potential difficulty and cost of enforcing strict prohibitions, the likelihood of alienating people from their government, and the grave karmic cost of imposing penal laws on segments of the population who do not accept it as legitimate. Additionally, Buddhist societies often permit other practices that they consider immoral, such as slaughtering and eating animals, due to their belief in not imposing Buddhist values on others by force.
### Category: qm-manyworlds
Question: Why is there no action at a distance in the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics?
Answer:In the MWI, there is no action at a distance because each measurement outcome creates a new world, so there is no need for action at a distance to transmit information between measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument, which requires action at a distance in order to explain nonlocality in quantum mechanics. However, the MWI still exhibits nonseparability of remote objects manifested in entanglement, which is a type of nonlocality that is still present in the framework of the MWI.
### Category: neo-daoism
Question: What does Guo Xiang propose as an alternative to the idea of causal agents in explaining being's existence?
Answer:Guo Xiang proposes "self-transformation" as an alternative to the idea of causal agents in explaining being's existence. This concept suggests that being exists eternally without needing a cause or reason, thus bypassing philosophical problems associated with causality and negation.
### Category: postmodernism
Question: What does Vattimo propose as the way to overcome modernity in the shared view of Nietzsche and Heidegger?
Answer:Vattimo proposes that overcoming modernity must be understood as Verwindung, which involves twisting or distorting modernity itself instead of progressing beyond it, in Nietzsche and Heidegger's shared view.
### Category: qt-nvd
Question: What challenges does AQFT face in constructing models?
Answer:AQFT has difficulty constructing models, despite having topological tools to define global quantities like temperature, energy, charge, and particle number using unitarily inequivalent representations. This is in contrast to LQFT, which is more mathematically amorphous but has recent algebraic constructions of low dimensional interacting models with no known Lagrangian, suggesting that AQFT might be more general than LQFT. However, LQFT provides constructive QFT with guidance on correctly building models corresponding to Lagrangians that have been empirically successful in particle physics.
### Category: critical-phil-race
Question: What intellectual movements significantly influenced the development of Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR)?
Answer:CPR was significantly influenced by Critical Legal Studies (CLS) and Critical Race Theory (CRT). These movements motivated scholars to go beyond questions of formal equality and de jure discrimination, and consider the subtle and broad reach of racist ideas and practices throughout social life and institutions.
### Category: logic-infinitary
Question: What can be obtained directly from Barwise's result regarding hypotheses justification?
Answer:One can obtain an inference rule that justifies hypotheses based on their explanatory power from Barwise's result.
### Category: grounding
Question: What is the definition of non-monotonicity in the context of grounding theory?
Answer:Non-monotonicity in grounding theory means that if a set of sentences grounds another sentence, adding new sentences to that original set does not necessarily preserve grounding. In other words, the new set of sentences may not ground the same sentence as before.
### Category: religious-language
Question: Why might face value theories of religious language be considered revisionary rather than descriptive?
Answer:Face value theories of religious language might be considered revisionary rather than descriptive because they seem to be based on contentious theological views about what can be represented in thought and language, rather than accurately reflecting what speakers mean when they use religious language. For example, the statement "God is good" may be used in various descriptive ways by speakers, such as being deemed true or false, used in arguments, embedded in conditionals, or expressed as matters of belief or knowledge. Any adequate account of religious language must take into account the evidence that religious utterances are used descriptively, particularly when it comes to statements like (a*).
### Category: schleiermacher
Question: Where was Schleiermacher, a prominent philosopher and theologian, born, and what was his father's profession?
Answer:Schleiermacher was born in Breslau, and his father was a clergyman of the reformed church.
### Category: induction-problem
Question: What kind of support or evidence is being claimed by someone who has encountered many instances of type f, and never an instance of type f which was not also type g?
Answer:In this scenario, the individual is claiming inductive support or evidence for their belief, as described by Strawson in 1952. This is because they have repeatedly observed that all instances of type f also belong to type g in their extensive experience.
### Category: identity-time
Question: What is the view that the only things that exist without qualification are presently existing things called?
Answer:This view is called Presentism. It holds that only presently existing things exist without qualification. So, on this view, if something exists in the past or future, it does not exist without qualification.
### Category: fitch-paradox
Question: What is an example of an inference rule in propositional logic that involves introducing a supposition?
Answer:An example of an inference rule in propositional logic that involves introducing a supposition is conditional introduction, which allows us to infer \(p \to q\) from the supposition \(\,p\,\) followed by \(q\), along with the cancellation of this supposition at the end of the derivation.
### Category: knowledge-how
Question: What are some terms used by philosophers to refer to practical concepts that are distinct from semantic and observational concepts?
Answer:Philosophers have used various terms to refer to practical concepts that are distinct from semantic and observational concepts, including "action-based ways of thinking," "executable ideas," "action concepts," and "practical modes of presentation." These concepts are thought to play a central role in explaining behavior and overcoming the interface problem between cognitive and motor representations. However, some intellectualists argue that we can dispense with practical modes of presentation altogether and instead appeal to ways of knowing that are distinctively practical or executive.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What can be inferred about a function \(k(x)\) if assuming it to be computable leads to contradictory situations?
Answer:If assuming \(k(x)\) to be computable results in contradictory situations, then \(k(x)\) is not computable.
### Category: divine-revelation
Question: How did Jenkins (1997) describe knowledge that is obtained through a cognitive process designed to attain truth?
Answer:Jenkins (1997) described knowledge that is obtained through a cognitive process designed to attain truth as being arrived at by the proper operation of such a process, even if it is infused and not natural.
### Category: francisco-sanches
Question: What significant section of Sanches's Quod nihil scitur is relevant for understanding Descartes's reflexive knowledge certainty, such as the cogito?
Answer:The pars construens of Sanches's Quod nihil scitur is particularly relevant for understanding Descartes's reflexive knowledge certainty, such as the cogito.
### Category: al-kindi
Question: Who does al-Kindi's concept of the "true One" resemble and what philosophical concept does it remind us of?
Answer:Al-Kindi's concept of the "true One" bears a strong resemblance to the first principle of the Neoplatonists and reminds us of Plato's Form of Equal. This is because al-Kindi's God is entirely one, not at all multiple, and explains the unity in other things, just as the Form of Equal serves to explain equality in other things.
### Category: qm
Question: What is the definition of having a value for an observable in the context of quantum mechanics?
Answer:According to the given definition, a system has a value for an observable if its state vector is an eigenstate of the operator corresponding to that observable, and in such a case, the value is the eigenvalue associated with that eigenstate.
### Category: proclus
Question: Who are some key figures in Neoplatonism?
Answer:Some key figures in Neoplatonism include Ammonius, Plotinus, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Simplicius, and Syrianus.
### Category: plato
Question: What is one of Plato's motivations for writing the Republic, and where does he show his interest in practical matters instead of wanting to escape from them?
Answer:One of Plato's motivations for writing the Republic is the desire to transform or improve political life. He shows his interest in practical matters in works such as Laws, where he discusses topics like voting procedures, punishments, education, legislation, and public officials' oversight. Additionally, Plato's letters indicate his interest in educating rulers to reform city politics if they are genuine.
### Category: logical-pluralism
Question: Why might it be difficult to decide if theoretical pluralism is true?
Answer:Deciding if theoretical pluralism is true can be difficult because it depends on substantial empirical claims for which the evidence may not yet have been gathered, it requires comparing its weight of virtues against rival theories (which may involve trade-offs with theoretical virtues such as simplicity), and it may ultimately depend on practical reasons for endorsing it rather than purely theoretical ones.
### Category: biomedicine
Question: What negative impact can well-meaning Western biomedical students have when they travel to low- and middle-income countries with limited biomedical skills and little knowledge of the populations or health needs?
Answer:Well-meaning Western biomedical students can negatively impact these communities by assuming that the populations are incapable of helping themselves and by lacking the necessary biomedical skills and knowledge of the populations' specific health needs.
### Category: francisco-sanches
Question: Who does the character in John Owen's book reject the idea that any knowledge can be attained by way of demonic states, prophecies, or dreams?
Answer:The character in John Owen's book, The Skeptics of the French Renaissance, rejects the idea that any knowledge can be attained by way of demonic states, prophecies, or dreams at the very beginning of the chapter on Sanches.
### Category: self-obligations
Question: How can moral duties that seem to be non-binding be shown to be binding?
Answer:To demonstrate that moral duties that appear to be non-binding could actually be binding, we require some method to justify them.
### Category: paradoxes-contemporary-logic
Question: Can you name a philosopher who presented an antinomy similar to Berry's paradox in the context of discussing Richard's paradox?
Answer:Beppo Levi, an Italian mathematician and philosopher, presented an antinomy similar to Berry's paradox in the context of discussing Richard's paradox in the early 1900s.
### Category: sellars
Question: Why does Sellars believe that the concepts of folk psychology cannot be replaced by the language of any scientific theory?
Answer:Sellars believes that the concepts of folk psychology cannot be replaced by the language of any scientific theory because they have a function that goes beyond just describing and explaining phenomena. Specifically, he argues that the language of agency is indispensable and cannot be replaced by scientific theory.
### Category: latin-american-metaphilosophy
Question: Why is Latin American philosophy notable for its early consideration of philosophical nature and significance?
Answer:Latin American philosophy stands out due to its early reflection on its own nature, significance, quality, and possibility of existence, sparking substantial debates about what qualifies as philosophical inquiry that have broader relevance beyond its regional context to metaphilosophy in general.
### Category: walter-chatton
Question: Why does Chatton argue that we must grant the existence of quantities as really distinct from other ontological categories?
Answer:Chatton argues that we must grant the existence of quantities as really distinct from other ontological categories because they are necessary to make propositions about quantified properties, such as "a heat causes heat," true. He believes that each category corresponds to a distinct ontological class, and thus that quantities must be recognized as a separate category from substances, qualities, and relations. This argument is part of his case-by-case defense of his ontological claim that there are ten categories of real things.
### Category: epistemology-language-tibetan
Question: How do Indian Buddhist epistemologists categorize what is referred to as "ultimate" in contrast with the "conventional"?
Answer:Indian Buddhist epistemologists categorize what is referred to as "ultimate" into two types in the Madhyamaka framework of the Two Truths: "correct conventional" (yang dag paʼi kun rdzob) and "incorrect conventional" (log paʼi kun rdzob).
### Category: mysticism
Question: What does Paul Marshall argue about extrovertive mystical experiences according to the provided text?
Answer:Paul Marshall argues that extrovertive mystical experiences are complete experiences in their own right and not merely stunted introvertive ones. He has also developed a detailed phenomenology of these experiences, as mentioned in the provided text.
### Category: law-ideology
Question: Who is associated with the political view that advocates for the organization of society on the basis of common ownership and democratic control of the means of production?
Answer:Socialism is associated with Friedrich Engels.
### Category: beauty
Question: What is one of the social responsibilities of art, according to Theodor Adorno in Aesthetic Theory?
Answer:According to Theodor Adorno in Aesthetic Theory, one of the social responsibilities of art is to denounce the world that creates and reproduces ugliness through injustice and oppression, rather than distract people from these brutal realities with beauty.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What is the smallest set that includes the numerals and variables \(x_0,x_1, \ldots\) and is closed under what two operations?
Answer:The smallest set containing the numerals, variables \(x_0,x_1, \ldots\) and closed under the operations \(t \mapsto s(t)\) and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n \mapsto \psi^n_i(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) where \(t,t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are terms and \(\psi^n_i\) is a primitive \(n\)-ary functional symbol is called the class of terms.

### Category: aristotle-mathematics
Question: What are three crucial notions in Aristotle's theory of scientific claims, as mentioned in the Posterior Analytics i.4?
Answer:The three crucial notions in Aristotle's theory of scientific claims, as mentioned in the Posterior Analytics i.4, are 'of every', 'per se' (kath’ hauto) or 'in virtue of itself' (in four ways), and 'universally' (katholou).
### Category: platonism
Question: What is nominalism in the context of metaphysics?
Answer:Nominalism is a philosophical view that holds that there are no abstract objects such as properties, propositions, or possible worlds. Instead, nominalists maintain that only concrete particulars exist.
### Category: associationist-thought
Question: What is the Law of Effect and what does it assert?
Answer:The Law of Effect is a canonical psychological law of associationist learning first proposed by Thorndike in 1911. It asserts that responses that are accompanied by positive feelings will be more likely to be associated with the situation in which the behavior was executed, while responses that are accompanied by negative feelings will make the response less likely to occur in the same situation in the future. The stronger the feelings produced, the greater the likelihood that the behavior will be evinced.
### Category: weyl
Question: Why did Hermann Weyl believe that mathematics should be extended to include notions beyond intuition?
Answer:Hermann Weyl believed that mathematics should be extended to include notions beyond intuition, such as the actual infinite, only if it plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences, where intuitive evidence must necessarily be transcended.
### Category: logic-classical
Question: What logical relationship between statements is represented by the symbol "\(\vee\)" in logic?
Answer:The symbol "\(\vee\)" in logic corresponds to the English "or", representing the logical disjunction between statements, where at least one of the two statements can be true.
### Category: meaning
Question: What is an example of two expressions that a Fregean might have difficulty claiming have the same content?
Answer:The example of two expressions that a Fregean might have difficulty claiming have the same content is "catsup" and "ketchup".
### Category: history
Question: Why does the choice of scale make an important difference in historical research?
Answer:The choice of scale in historical research is important because social life is fundamentally heterogeneous, meaning that different levels of analysis can yield different insights and findings about the topic of interest. By focusing on different scales, historians can uncover unique patterns, processes, and relationships that might not be apparent at other levels of analysis, which can ultimately lead to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the past.
### Category: grosseteste
Question: Did Robert Grosseteste set up controlled experiment as the primary method by which scientific knowledge is to be obtained?
Answer:No, Robert Grosseteste did not set up controlled experiment as the primary method by which scientific knowledge is to be obtained. He employed the notion of controlled experiment and related it to demonstrative science, but it is only one among many ways of arriving at such knowledge and is not given particular emphasis in his writings.
### Category: induction-problem
Question: What is the purpose of using an inductive argument (S) in justifying the supposition that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future?
Answer:The purpose of using inductive argument (S) is to provide support for the claim that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future, based on the success of past instances of arguments that relied upon it.
### Category: qt-quantlog
Question: What is the difference between the classical and quantum mechanical approach in identifying testable properties of a physical system?
Answer:In classical mechanics, testable properties of a physical system correspond to Borel sets in the state-space, which form a Boolean algebra. However, in quantum mechanics, only subsets of the state-space corresponding to closed subspaces of the Hilbert space are testable, which do not form a Boolean algebra.
### Category: logic-temporal
Question: What is an interval model in interval-based temporal logic?
Answer:An interval model in interval-based temporal logic is a triple \(\mathcal{M} = \langle T,\prec,V\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) is a temporal frame, and \(V\) is a valuation function that assigns to each atomic proposition \(p\) a set of time intervals \(V(p) \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{I}(\mathcal{T}))\) at which \(p\) is considered true.
### Category: marcus-aurelius
Question: What is the Stoic doctrine that explains our natural tendency to care for others?
Answer:The Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis is the idea that we have a natural tendency to care for others, starting with our family and friends and ultimately extending to our fellow-citizens and fellow-humans.
### Category: yorck
Question: Who does Dilthey see as making progress in articulating the Christian insight into inwardness and historicity of life?
Answer:Dilthey sees Schleiermacher and Kant as making progress in articulating the Christian insight into inwardness and historicity of life.
### Category: freedom-ancient
Question: Why does accepting the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP) lead to the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for acting virtuously?
Answer:According to PAP, an agent is only morally responsible for their actions if they could have done otherwise. However, if we apply this principle to virtuous people, we would have to conclude that they cannot act viciously or do anything wrong. In the scenario where a virtuous person has promised their child a piece of cake if they finish their dinner, if they were capable of acting viciously by not keeping their promise, then they would not truly be virtuous. Therefore, if we accept PAP, we would have to accept the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for acting virtuously because they cannot do anything other than the virtuous action in any situation.
### Category: utilitarianism-history
Question: How does John Stuart Mill propose to solve a problem for utilitarianism in regards to intellectual pleasures being superior?
Answer:John Stuart Mill argues that those persons who have experienced both intellectual pleasures and other pleasures view the former as better than the latter. He uses examples such as preferring to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied, implying that intellectual pleasures have higher value.
### Category: experimental-moral
Question: What is the claim of empirically-minded critics regarding the dissimilarity between the dispositions most people have and the dispositions that count as virtues?
Answer:Empirically-minded critics of virtue ethics argue that the dispositions most people have are structurally dissimilar from virtues as traditionally understood. They claim that this discrepancy may be psychologically unrealistic to bridge, implying that traditional virtue may not function well as a regulative ideal for most people's development

Question: What is one of the topics discussed in the collections commemorating Thomas Luckmann and the fiftieth anniversary of The Social Construction of Reality that relates to how Schutz's thought preserves agents' potential to resist societal control?
Answer:One of the topics discussed in the collections commemorating Thomas Luckmann and the fiftieth anniversary of The Social Construction of Reality that relates to how Schutz's thought preserves agents' potential to resist societal control is the Schutzian paradigm's preservation of agents' potential to resist societal control in contrast to Bourdieu’s account of habitus (Dreher 2019).
### Category: double-consciousness
Question: What is the significance of the concept of 'double-consciousness' in Du Bois's Souls?
Answer:The concept of 'double-consciousness' in Du Bois's Souls refers to a complex and persistent form of consciousness experienced by people of African descent in America, who feel an internal conflict between their own cultural identity and the racial prejudices imposed upon them by society. It is a socio-cultural construct rather than a biological given and is often associated with the metaphor of the 'veil' that separates and alienates them from mainstream American society. Although Du Bois did not use the terms 'double-consciousness' and 'second-sight' extensively after 1903, they have had a significant impact on philosophical interpretations of his thought and continue to influence views on race and identity.

### Category: henry-more
Question: Who did More accuse of confusing the divine nature with the nature of created things, thereby committing what More saw as a form of atheism?
Answer:More accused Spinoza of confusing the divine nature with the nature of created things, thereby committing what More saw as a form of atheism. More took this view of Spinoza's philosophy because he identified Spinoza's one substance with matter, which he saw as incompatible with God's absolute perfection.
### Category: evolution-cultural
Question: What is one potential issue with group selection in the context of cumulative adaptation?
Answer:One potential issue with group selection is that it can be vulnerable to 'subversion from within', where individual organisms go it alone and sabotage complex features of group organization in favor of their own fitness. This can undermine individual-level adaptation because genes in an organism typically share a 'common fate' and do not behave as if they were in direct competition with each other.

### Category: propositions-singular
Question: What is the claim of the view that follows Adams 1981 regarding the truth of quantified propositions?
Answer:The view that follows Adams 1981 claims that quantified propositions can be true at a possible world even if there are no corresponding singular propositions that could have been true at that world. This requires abandoning a general analysis of the truth of quantified propositions in terms of atomic propositions.

Answer:Logics of conditionals focus on formalizing the properties of conditional assertions such as if \(p\) then \(q\), while logics of belief revision focus on capturing the rules and constraints that should apply when an agent’s set of beliefs is to be revised on receipt of new information which may not even be consistent with the original set of beliefs.
### Category: lefevre-etaples
Question: What is the philosophical position that Lefèvre's dialogue in his notes on Aristotle's Categories suggests regarding universals?
Answer:The philosophical position suggested by Lefèvre's dialogue on universals is that of moderate realism, where there is something conceptual that is "added" to the qualities of both the thing and the word signifying that thing, implying that universals share common characteristics but also have conventions in language associated with them.
### Category: holism-social
Question: How can methodological holism be understood in terms of its scope of application in social sciences?
Answer:Methodological holism can be understood in two ways based on its scope of application in social sciences - it can either be applied to all explanations advanced within social sciences or it can pertain solely to final explanations that are satisfactory. Methodological individualists often view the debate as concerning final explanations only.
### Category: paradox-suspense

### Category: physics-Rpcc
Question: What are three equivalent formulations of the Causal Markov Condition for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in terms of conditional probabilistic independence?
Answer:The three equivalent formulations of the Causal Markov Condition for a DAG are: (1) if X is d-separated from Y given Z in \(\mathcal{G}\), then X is independent of Y given Z in p; (2) every probability distribution p over the algebra generated by the variables that factors according to \(\mathcal{G}\) satisfies the Causal Markov Condition; (3) if X is not an ancestor of Y in \(\mathcal{G}\), then X is independent of Y given the parents of Y in p.
### Category: descriptions
Question: What is the significance of definite and indefinite descriptions in various fields of study?
Answer:Definite and indefinite descriptions have played an important role in debates about metaphysics, epistemology, semantics, psychology, logic, and linguistics ever since the publication of Bertrand Russell’s paper “On Denoting” in 1905. Despite their apparent simplicity, there have been heated debates among philosophers and linguists about their proper analysis. Some treat definite descriptions as referential expressions, while others treat them as quantificational expressions or predicational expressions. Some even argue that definite and indefinite determiners do not correspond to logical elements in natural language.
### Category: aristotle-logic
Question: What is Aristotle's view on the purpose of providing a definition?
Answer:According to Aristotle, providing a definition is about stating what something is, rather than simply specifying the meaning of a word. He considers defining as an account of what it is to be (logos ho to ti ên einai sêmainei) for some existent thing.

Answer:According to Cross's account of how-questions, a direct answer to a how-question is defined as a proposition that stands in a contextually determined relation of explanatory relevance to the topic/contrast-class pair of the how-question. The contrast value of the how-question determines whether all members of the contrast class other than the topic proposition are presupposed to be true or false.
### Category: chemistry
Question: Why is the appeal to the Boltzmann distribution in reducing the concept of temperature circular?
Answer:The appeal is circular because the Boltzmann distribution is expressed as a function of temperature and its derivation from Boltzmann's microscopic construal of entropy requires appealing to the thermodynamic law connecting entropy with temperature. Thus, it assumes what it aims to explain.
### Category: boyle
Question: What significant event led Robert Boyle to renew his commitment to Christianity and what motivated him to uphold this renewed commitment?
Answer:Robert Boyle had a profound spiritual experience one summer night when he was frightened by an intense thunderstorm, which led him to fear that the Day of Judgment had arrived. This experience inspired him to make a vow that he would employ the remainder of his life in a more religious and careful manner. Upon realizing that his vow was made under duress, Boyle repeated his commitment under a clear sky in a solemn manner, dating his conversion from that day forward. He was determined to uphold this more deliberate consecration of himself to piety not due to fear, but motivated by the inherent excellence of Christianity itself (BP 37:181r-v, Hunter 1994a, 16).
### Category: self-consciousness

### Category: david-lewis
Question: What is an example that illustrates the concept of 'trumping pre-emption' where the prior event does not cause the outcome, even though the outcome quasi-depends on it?
Answer:In the example, both the Major and the Sergeant order the troops to advance, and they do advance. Intuitively, it is the Major, not the Sergeant, who caused the advance, since the Major’s orders have priority. But the advance does quasi-depend on the Sergeant’s orders, since in a world where the Major doesn’t make an order, the advance does depend on the Sergeant.

### Category: logical-form
Question: Why might it be challenging to believe that the meaning of a sentence is fixed by the modes of combination and relevant word meanings?
Answer:It might be challenging to believe that the meaning of a sentence is fixed by the modes of combination and relevant word meanings because it is unclear how this could be true if there are widespread mismatches between logical and grammatical form. However, this hypothesis is difficult to falsify because children with finite cognitive resources can typically acquire the capacity to understand the endlessly many expressions of the languages spoken around them, suggesting a strong connection between logical form and semantic compositionality in natural languages.
### Category: pleasure
Question: What common characteristic might various types of pleasures have, as suggested by the quoted saying among Afghan men and other examples given?
Answer:The common characteristic that these pleasures might share is that they all involve heightened sensory experience and the thrill of aliveness, which could also include emotional engagement, anticipation, and release. This is because the examples given range from physical pleasures such as hot baths and sexual activities, to emotional ones such as seeing one’s son grown to manhood and watching horror movies, as well as social pleasures such as spending time with friends.
### Category: habermas
Question: What type of discourse does Habermas associate with authenticity claims, and what kind of reasons constitute cogent arguments in this type of discourse?
Answer:Habermas associates authenticity claims with "ethical" discourse. In this type of discourse, the reasons that constitute cogent arguments depend on the life histories, traditions, and particular values of those whose good is at issue. This means that one should not expect those reasons to win universal consensus. However, Habermas recognizes one class of ethical questions that do admit of universal consensus - choices of technologies that bear on the future of human nature. Such issues concern how we should understand our basic human dignity, and the core of human dignity lies in the capacity of human beings for autonomous self-determination.
### Category: operationalism
Question: What was the method Bridgman advocated for according to his retrospective given in the 1953 AAAS conference?

Question: What modification to the concept of truth conduciveness does the Analysis debate suggest?
Answer:The Analysis debate suggests that the concept of truth conduciveness should be modified such that it takes into account all relevant evidence, including beliefs and testimonies, when considering relevant probabilities.
### Category: ethics-deontological
Question: What type of rights do patient-centered deontological theories focus on and what specific right is often mentioned as their core right?
Answer:Patient-centered deontological theories focus on people's rights, with a specific right against being used only as means for producing good consequences without one's consent being often mentioned as their core right. This core right is not to be confused with more discrete rights such as the right against being killed or being killed intentionally, but rather it is a right against being used by another for the user’s or others’ benefit without one's consent. This notion can be found in the works of both Right Libertarians and Left-Libertarians as well as other philosophers such as Quinn, Kamm, Alexander, Ferzan, Gauthier, and Walen.
### Category: plato-parmenides
Question: What logical consequence follows from the conjunction of D5 and D6 in this philosophical argument?

### Category: mohism
Question: Why might the Mohists argue that we should still practice equal care, even if it goes beyond our basic obligations?
Answer:The Mohists might argue that we should still practice equal care, even if it goes beyond our basic obligations, because it is the way of the sage-kings and the intention of Heaven, the highest moral exemplar, and its practice produces great benefit for the world. They recognize no distinction between obligation and supererogation, and perhaps their religious beliefs convince them that the best life is one that most fully complies with Heaven’s desire that we care for and benefit others. Additionally, many Mohists particularly revered and emulated Yu, the most self-sacrificing and altruistic of the sage-kings.
### Category: computational-mind
Question: Do proponents of CCTM+RTM who embrace a physicalist outlook believe that mental computations are implemented by physical stuff or Cartesian soul-stuff?
Answer:Proponents of CCTM+RTM who embrace a physicalist outlook believe that mental computations are implemented by physical stuff, specifically the brain. They hold that Mentalese symbols are realized by neural states, and computational operations over Mentalese symbols are realized by neural processes.
### Category: kant-development
Question: What is the medium that Kant claims carries warmth and light in his energetic model of matter?
Answer:In Kant's energetic model of matter, heat is a symptom of molecular vibration, which in turn depends on the energy-state of a body. He identifies the carrier of warmth and light as the ether, which he also calls "fire-matter." This ether permeates the molecular interstices of bodies, according to Kant's propositions.
### Category: astell

### Category: physics-holism
Question: What does Seevinck's (2004) criterion of holism state about the possibility of inferring global properties of a physical theory using only local resources?
Answer:According to Seevinck's (2004) criterion of holism, it is impossible in principle to infer the global properties of a physical theory using only local resources, which include all local operations and classical communication. This criterion requires specifying how a theory assigns properties, and Seevinck (2004) argues that neither classical physics nor Bohmian mechanics is holistic in this sense.

### Category: natural-kinds
Question: How does Putnam's Division of Linguistic Labor propose that the referents of terms can be fixed according to an individual's knowledge or beliefs?
Answer:Putnam's Division of Linguistic Labor suggests that the referents of terms used by an individual can be fixed not by their own knowledge or beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain experts to whom they defer. This means that ordinary speakers who use terms like 'aluminium' and 'molybdenum' can have differentiated referring capacities without any difference in knowledge of the referents, because their referential capacities are parasitic on those of the experts who have the required discriminating knowledge. The experts' knowledge fixes the referents of their own use of these terms, and the ordinary speakers' deference to these experts as those who could tell them which things are aluminium and which are molybdenum ensures that their own referents of 'aluminium' and 'molybdenum' are the same as those of the experts.
### Category: metaphor
Question: How might a philosophy professor try to explain the word "floor" to an extraterrestrial being?
Answer:A philosophy professor might try to explain the word "floor" by using various demonstrative methods such as leading the extraterrestrial being from floor to floor, pointing at the floor, stamping on it, and repeatedly saying the word "floor". This approach is aimed at conveying the meaning of the word through demonstration and repetition.

### Category: idealism
Question: What is McTaggart's ontological position as stated in his work "An Ontological Idealism"?
Answer:McTaggart is an ontological idealist who believes that all that exists is spiritual. He holds this conviction based on the claim that only this conception of ultimate reality allows us to overcome unavoidable contradictions between unity and diversity in reality. He supports this view through various considerations throughout his writings, including relying on Bradley's views about contradictions as a criterion for non-reality, employing mereological considerations concerning the structure of substances, and presenting arguments based on his theory of time. In his magnum opus The Nature of Existence, he aims to prove that all that really exists are substances, which are infinitely divisible and cannot have simple parts, and that individual features of substances obtain a relation of determining correspondence with all other features. The second volume of this work focuses on establishing these a priori characteristics of what can exist.
### Category: prop-attitude-reports
Question: What does Braun argue is the source of the difference in intuitions regarding the truth-value of typical utterances of (1) and (4)?
Answer:Braun argues that the difference in implicature-potential between the unembedded sentences (5) and (6) is the source of the difference in intuitions regarding the truth-value of typical utterances of (1) and (4). He does not think it is necessary to insist that typical utterances of (1) and (4) convey information about how Lois believes what she believes.
### Category: marriage
Question: What is the Christian philosophical perspective on lust within marriage according to St. Augustine?
Answer:According to St. Augustine, lust within marriage is considered a venial (pardonable) sin, as long as it is not the sole reason for the marital sexual act. Marital sex should ideally be performed for the purpose of procreation, and sex solely to satisfy lust is not entirely without sin but is still considered less serious than engaging in extra-marital sex (fornication).

### Category: collective-intentionality
Question: What is the view that emerges from Scheler's analysis of joint intentionality, which challenges the idea that it is a combination of individual intentionality with reciprocal awareness?
Answer:Scheler's view is that when people share an attitude, it is not the case that each participant has an attitude of their own. Instead, the intentional attitude is really one and the same, so that many minds are in a numerically identical state.
### Category: religion-politics
Question: Why might the content of public reason be considered too thin to settle anything of importance in a democratic system?
Answer:The content of public reason may be too thin to settle anything of importance in a democratic system because it may not be what reasonable and autonomous agents would primarily appeal to when attempting to settle fundamental political questions. Additionally, it is unclear that reasonable and autonomous agents would regard as inappropriate a democratic system in which agents bring to the table whatever reasons that seem best to them and vote solely on their basis.
### Category: feminism-liberal
Question: What do socially conservative equity feminists think about the role of the state in discouraging disfavored ways of life?
Answer:Socially conservative equity feminists believe that while the state should not force citizens to accept traditional family forms, it should discourage disfavored ways of life and encourage favored ones through noncoercive, nonstate means. They argue that when feminism strays from its political role of assuring equal rights and ventures into women’s personal lives, it tends to discourage in women the kinds of delayed gratification and self-sacrifice on which vital social institutions, like the family, depend.

Answer:The second question can be framed in terms of aesthetic experience: can Kant allow for an experience of displeasure in the ugly, and if he can, is it symmetrical with pleasure in the beautiful?
### Category: truthlikeness
Question: What is the problem with Popper's initial proposal of measuring a theory's truthlikeness by counting all its true and false consequences?
Answer:The problem with Popper's initial proposal is that it involves an enormous amount of double counting and leads to the Tichý-Miller trivialization result, as it arbitrarily counts the consequences of a theory without discrimination.
### Category: identity-transworld
Question: What is an individual essence if we find the idea of possible worlds that differ only in the identities of some of the individuals unacceptable?
Answer:If we find it intolerable that there are possible worlds that differ only in the identities of some of the individuals, then we must suppose that individuals have non-trivial individual essences. An individual essence of Adam is an essential property (or set of properties) that is both essential to being Adam and also such that it is not possessed by any individual other than Adam in any possible world. In other words, it guarantees that its possessor is Adam and no one else.

Question: How does Craig Carr challenge the idea that coercion is antithetical to freedom?
Answer:Craig Carr challenges the idea that coercion is antithetical to freedom by pointing out that if coercion involves making choices, then being able to make one's own choices is part of what it means to be free. He argues that it is unclear in what sense coercion is in tension with freedom if some instances of coercion involve making choices.

### Category: skepticism-latin-america
Question: What is the role of haíresis in neo-Pyrrhonism according to Porchat?
Answer:Haíresis in neo-Pyrrhonism refers to a skeptical view of the world that is an elaboration of how things appear to neo-Pyrrhonists. This view is expressed as a discourse about phenomena and can vary between individuals since it depends on their personal circumstances.
### Category: qualia-knowledge
Question: What position does Jackson adopt in his more recent works regarding the knowledge argument and qualia?
Answer:In his more recent works, Jackson argues that knowledge about qualia is impossible if qualia are epiphenomenal, and he concludes that something must be wrong with the knowledge argument. He suggests that this argument goes wrong in presupposing a false view about sensory experience, and he advocates for strong representationalism, which holds that to be in a phenomenal state is to represent objective properties where both the properties represented and the representing can be given a physicalist account. Jackson admits that there is a specific phenomenal way of representing but insists that it can be accounted for in physicalist terms. He aims to develop an account of knowledge about one's own phenomenal states that does not imply a causal relation between qualia and phenomenal knowledge about qualia.
### Category: fleck
Question: Does Fleck believe that science contains an objective picture of the world?
Answer:No, Fleck does not believe that science contains an objective picture of the world due to its constantly changing nature. However, he does use the term "truth" in reference to scientific statements and emphasizes that truth is not subjective or relative.

### Category: locke-moral
Question: What is the difference between natural good and moral good, according to Locke?
Answer:According to Locke, the difference between natural good and moral good lies in the different context for pleasures and pains that distinguishes the moral from the natural. While natural good involves physical pleasure arising from natural sources, moral good is a pleasure arising from one's conformity to moral dictates, and moral evil is pain arising from the failure to conform. The pleasure and pain are not qualitatively distinct in these cases, but they take on a special significance as a result of the considerations that bring them about.

Question: Why might some biology experiments be given a special epistemic status in textbooks despite not being "crucial experiments"?
Answer:There can be other rationales for giving certain biology experiments a special epistemic status in textbooks, such as their illustrative value in demonstrating particular scientific principles or methods. This special status does not necessarily imply that these experiments have exceptional evidential force in justifying scientific hypotheses or theories.
### Category: consciousness
Question: What must dualists and property dualists who reject a physicalist ontology of consciousness do in order to explain or model consciousness as a nonphysical aspect of reality?
Answer:Dualists and property dualists who reject a physicalist ontology of consciousness must develop the details of their theories in ways that articulate the specific natures of the relevant non-physical features of reality with which they equate consciousness or to which they appeal in order to explain it.
### Category: foucault
Question: What was the view on sexuality in the 1960s and 1970s that Foucault critiques in his book?
Answer:In the 1960s and 1970s, it was commonly believed that there was a natural and healthy sexuality shared by all human beings, which was currently being repressed by cultural prohibitions and conventions such as bourgeois morality and capitalist socio-economic structures. This repressed sexuality was thought to be the cause of various neuroses and it was considered important to have an active and free sexuality. The popular discourse on sexuality during this time thus strongly advocated for sexual liberation, with the goal of freeing people's true sexuality from the repressive mechanisms of power.

### Category: hermann-helmholtz
Question: What is an example given by Helmholtz of a judgment of relative spatial position?
Answer:Helmholtz gives the case of someone grasping a pen in her fingers as an example of a judgment of relative spatial position. This is because the sensation from each finger only provides information about the position of the pen relative to that finger, not its absolute position. The belief in the pen's absolute position is inferred based on additional knowledge, such as the fact that her fingers are close enough together that only one pen can fit between them.
### Category: model-theory

### Category: francis-bacon
Question: Why did Bacon not consider simple enumeration as a universal method of science?
Answer:Bacon did not consider simple enumeration as a universal method of science because of his preference for theories that deal with interior physical causes, which are not immediately observable. Instead, he favored the inductive method that starts from sensible experience, uses tables of presentation to correct and extend sense-data into facts, and derives lower axioms or propositions through abstraction of notions.

Question: What is one example of how idealization is used in scientific practices?
Answer:In scientific practices, one example of idealization is depicting the interior space of a cell as relatively empty, even though it is known that intracellular space is crowded. This idealization involves knowingly ignoring variations in properties or excluding particular values for variables for descriptive and explanatory purposes.
### Category: intention
Question: What challenge is posed by the desire to relate intention to the mental state of belief, if intention is not considered to be a mental state itself?
Answer:The challenge is that if intention is not a mental state but rather a way of being in progress, then relating it to the mental state of belief becomes more puzzling. This issue is addressed again in section 5 of the discussed text.
### Category: feminist-science
Question: Why does Anderson consider Stewart et al.’s work to be better science?

### Category: substance
Question: Why does the issue of the unity of the species or secondary substance arise in Aristotle's work?
Answer:The issue arises because properties of objects seem to belong to them in different ways when they are part of a definition as opposed to when they are not. Aristotle is questioning why the collection of properties that make up a species or secondary substance is different from any other collection of properties.
### Category: chinese-room
Question: What impact did Searle's Chinese Room Argument have on the philosophical theory of Functionalism?
Answer:Searle's Chinese Room Argument significantly damaged Functionalism, which was then the dominant theory in philosophy of mind. The argument posed a strong challenge to the idea that computers could have mental states if Functionalism were correct, leading many to argue that the theory has never fully recovered from Searle's critique.
### Category: ludwig-feuerbach
Question: What role do non-egoistic species-drives play in Feuerbach's philosophy?
Answer:In Feuerbach's philosophy, non-egoistic species-drives (Gattungstriebe) are psychological manifestations that individuals periodically find themselves overwhelmed by, particularly in poets and thinkers. These drives represent the species-essence of humanity and serve as the norm or ideal toward which individuals strive in their efforts at self-transcendence. Examples of such drives include the experiences of erotic and platonic love, the drive to knowledge, being moved by music, voice of conscience, compassion, admiration, and the urge to overcome one's own moral and intellectual limitations.
### Category: algebra
Question: Why might algebra be of philosophical interest from the perspective of the foundations of mathematics?
Answer:Algebra is of philosophical interest from the perspective of the foundations of mathematics because it is strikingly different from other branches of mathematics in its domain independence and its close affinity to formal logic. Additionally, elementary algebra and abstract algebra reflect a certain duality in reasoning that resembles Descartes' Cartesian Dualism, with the former dealing with the reasoning process and the latter dealing with that which is reasoned about, as the mind and body of mathematics.
### Category: depiction
Question: What problem do some theorists raise against resemblance theories of depiction regarding representations of fictional individuals or kinds of objects?
Answer:Some theorists argue that if resemblance is a relation between existing particulars, then resemblance theories cannot explain how pictures that represent fictional individuals (like Zeus or Pegasus) or genre pictures, which represent kinds of objects without representing any particular instances of them, can resemble what they represent. This criticism challenges the ability of resemblance theories to provide a general explanation of depiction.
### Category: molecular-genetics
Question: What is the definition of a gene according to Waters (2000)?

### Category: prop-attitude-reports
Question: What is the position that Richard takes in 1983 regarding substitution-failure intuitions and why does he believe it is necessary?
Answer:Richard takes the position that substitution-failure intuitions should be explained pragmatically rather than semantically in order to avoid having substitution-failures outside the scope of attitude verbs. He believes this is necessary because otherwise it would be unacceptable. He also argues that the same explanation should be used for both Frege's and Kripke's puzzles, which leads to Naive Russellianism.

### Category: kant-aesthetics
Question: What is the relationship between imagination and understanding according to Kant in his Critique of Judgment?
Answer:In his Critique of Judgment, Kant suggests that imagination and understanding can stand in a different kind of relationship than in his Critique of Pure Reason. In this relationship, imagination and understanding harmonize with each other without imagination being constrained or governed by understanding. This results in a non-conceptual perceptual response, which is the basis for a judgment of taste and is accompanied by a feeling of disinterested pleasure.

Answer:The propositions as types principle is not maintained in partial type theory, but it is maintained in intuitionistic type theory.
### Category: modularity-mind
Question: What is one possible solution to the Domain Integration Problem in the context of massive modularity?
Answer:One possible solution to the Domain Integration Problem is that the language system has the capacity to play the role of content integrator in virtue of its capacity to transform conceptual representations that have been linguistically encoded.
### Category: epistemology-visual-thinking
Question: How can we determine the maximum number of guards that can be placed on vertices such that every triangle is in the view of a guard?
Answer:We can determine this by finding the minimum number of vertices that cannot have a guard placed on them, which is equivalent to finding the minimum number of vertices that must be colored blue (\(b\)) in a graph with \(n\) vertices. Since \(b\) is minimal, it must be less than or equal to the number of vertices of any other color and less than or equal to \(n/3\). Therefore, we can place at most \(\lfloor n/3 \rfloor\) guards on vertices such that every triangle is in the view of a guard.
### Category: aristotle-logic

Answer:Frede 1981 and Ebert 1985 have discussed Aristotle's lists of categories in additional works beyond Allen L. Back's.
### Category: moral-epistemology
Question: How can the threat of circularity be averted in understanding moral fact as independent of our opinions about it and our procedures for trying to establish it?
Answer:The threat of circularity can be averted by understanding moral fact as independent of our opinions about it and our procedures for trying to establish it, in either the realist sense of fact (one not reducible to what we can agree upon or what our methods would determine) or in an objective sense that allows for the possibility of massive moral error despite our efforts to the contrary. This suggestion is adequate if it can successfully respond to objections such as sociological, psychological, ontological, evolutionary, and methodological, which argue against knowing moral facts in the same sense that we know other facts about the world.

Question: What is Fichte's solution to the problem of dualism between subject and object in modern philosophy?
Answer:Fichte's solution to the problem of dualism between subject and object in modern philosophy is to postulate an "identical subject-object," which is a subject that produces objectivity by positing objective reality as distinct from itself. However, Fichte's solution still suffers from an inadequacy in that he conceives of the constitutive activity as the act of an individual subject confronted with an external, alien reality.
### Category: gomez-pereira
Question: What are the four phases of Pereira's explanation of the first type of movement?
Answer:The four phases of Pereira's explanation of the first type of movement are: (1) stimulation of the sensory organs by an object, (2) transmission of the alteration in the sensory organ to the brain, (3) activation of the areas in the brain where motor nerves originate, and (4) activation of the nerves that causes contraction and distention of muscles and generates movement.
### Category: ethics-ai
Question: What is an example of an existential risk that superintelligent systems could pose to humanity?
Answer:One example of an existential risk that superintelligent systems could pose to humanity is that they may decide to end human existence because their preferences conflict with the existence of humans on Earth, and they may have the power to do so due to their superior intelligence.
### Category: immunology
Question: How does the dominant model of immune cognition understand the immune response?
Answer:The dominant model of immune cognition understands the immune response as involving two steps: first, the immune system perceives molecular targets, and then it decides how to react based on this perception. This model construes immunity as an information-processing faculty, where immune activity becomes a computational process involving algorithmic transformation of an antigenic input into an effector output.
### Category: quotation
Question: Who is a philosopher that is known for his work on the indeterminacy of translation and the idea that meaning is based on truth conditions?
Answer:Donald Davidson is a philosopher who is known for his work on the indeterminacy of translation and the idea that meaning is based on truth conditions.
### Category: bolzano-logic
Question: How does Bolzano view the composition of all ideas, according to the text?
Answer:Bolzano is a semantic atomist who believes that all ideas are ultimately composed of simple parts, which are themselves ideas. In the case of simple ideas with objects, there is no content strictly speaking since there are no parts, and hence no structure either. Thus such ideas are individuated by their extensions alone.
### Category: impartiality
Question: What argument does James Griffin provide against consequentialist impartiality with regards to prudential values?
Answer:James Griffin argues that many prudential values involve commitments to particular persons, institutions, causes, and careers. He contends that one cannot fully flourish and live a prudentially good life without becoming partially committed to these aspects of their life. This partiality becomes part of one's identity and cannot be entered into or exited from at will, according to Griffin's argument.
### Category: metaphysical-explanation
Question: What kind of account of metaphysical explanation might depend on psychological factors such as the cognitive sophistication of its likely recipients?
Answer:A less than fully realist account of metaphysical explanation might depend on psychological factors such as the cognitive sophistication of its likely recipients.
### Category: popper
Question: What must every test of a theory ultimately stop at and require acceptance of, according to Popper?
Answer:Every test of a theory must ultimately stop at some basic statement or other which we decide to accept, according to Popper.
### Category: type-theory
Question: What is the significance of the axiom \(U:U\) in type theory, and why is it inconsistent as a logical system?
Answer:The axiom \(U:U\) in type theory suggests that the universe is strongly typed, meaning that every object belongs to some type. However, as shown by J.Y. Girard in 1972, this system is inconsistent as a logical system. The inconsistency is not due to a direct reproduction of Russell's paradox using a set of all sets, but rather due to a more subtle derivation of contradiction. This derivation can now be reduced to Russell's paradox by representing sets as pointed graphs (Miquel 2001). It is worth noting that Girard's paradox was first obtained for a weaker system and was later refined (Coquand 1994, Hurkens 1995). The notion of pure type system (Barendregt 1992) is useful in obtaining a sharp formulation of these paradoxes.
### Category: trust
Question: What is Karen Jones' criticism of Potter's virtue theory of trustworthiness regarding being untrustworthy?
Answer:Karen Jones argues that if being trustworthy is a virtue, then being untrustworthy would be a vice. However, we can be required to be untrustworthy in certain situations where we cannot fulfill our commitments to two different people due to incompatible demands. To uphold her virtue theory, Potter would need to maintain that we are obligated to either disappoint someone's trust instead of being untrustworthy or to be untrustworthy in a limited sense.
### Category: early-modern-india
Question: Who is responsible for the standard Nyāya view on there being six types of sense-object relations that form the basis of perceptual experiences?
Answer:The standard Nyāya view on there being six types of sense-object relations that form the basis of perceptual experiences is attributed to Uddyotakara in The Manual of Reason (TS 48).
### Category: truth-correspondence
Question: Why do complex beliefs and their contents pose a problem for the friends of Russellian propositions?
Answer:Complex beliefs and their contents pose a problem for the friends of Russellian propositions because, according to them, every true complex belief corresponds to a complex fact (or state of affairs). This implies that there must be at least as many complex facts (or states of affairs) as there are true complex beliefs, which is difficult to accept for those who believe in logical atomism, as it may only work for sentences and Fregean propositions but not Russellian propositions.
### Category: femapproach-pragmatism
Question: What was the role of women in classical American pragmatism and how did pragmatism influence their approach to social reform movements?
Answer:Women played significant roles in the development and articulation of classical American pragmatism. They used pragmatism as a philosophic practice that brought theory and practice together, which helped them trust in and learn from experience and intellectually engage in various social reform movements. Pragmatism provided these women with a method of reforming politics and culture by accommodating their new academic and political engagement with the world. Notable women in classical American pragmatism include Jane Addams, Mary Parker Follett, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Emily Greene Balch, Lucy Sprague Mitchell, Anna Julia Cooper, Mary Whiton Calkins, and Ella Flagg Young. These women brought added dimensions to pragmatism and reminded us of the issues that were subsequently left behind as American philosophy became more exclusively technical and academic.
### Category: causation-backwards
Question: What kind of issues does the concept of backward causation bring up that must be addressed in order to establish a physically adequate notion?
Answer:The concept of backward causation raises questions about the adequacy of physical theories, which need to be answered before a satisfactory notion can be developed. These issues include the order of cause and effect, the direction of time, and the potential implications of causation that moves backward in time.

### Category: tarski
Question: What concern does Tarski express about including logical signs such as implication or universal quantification as extra-logical terms in his definition of logical consequence?
Answer:Tarski expresses concern that including logical signs such as implication or universal quantification as extra-logical terms in his definition of logical consequence would lead to results that contradict ordinary usage, as it would not declare many instances of the relation consecrated by the common usage of logicians as logical consequences.
### Category: al-farabi-psych
Question: What is al-Fārābī's philosophical view regarding the relationship between matter and form?
Answer:Al-Fārābī is an Aristotelian hylomorphismpartisan who believes that form is the actualization of matter and is more excellent than matter, while matter is the substratum of form and is dependent on it. He applies this view to his understanding of the soul as the form of the body, which is perishable with the body.
### Category: vagueness
Question: Why might an epistemicist assign some small probability to hypotheses identifying particular thresholds?
Answer:An epistemicist might assign some small probability to hypotheses identifying particular thresholds because if they wagered against each number being the threshold, they must have placed a losing bet somewhere in order to make the transition to oldness. This is because if they won each bet, there was no opportunity for them to make the transition to oldness. A bookie could have made a "Dutch book" against them, collecting payment without having to identify which bet they lost. Since probabilities can be extracted from hypothetical betting behavior, they must actually assign some small probability to these hypotheses.
### Category: metaphysics-massexpress
Question: Who are some philosophers that have been associated with the idea of a unique ontic category for plural entities?
Answer:Henry Laycock and Michael Burke have been associated with the idea of a unique ontic category for plural entities, which are not individual items of quantification.
### Category: mathematics-explanation
Question: Why does Brumfiel not use the transfer principle in his method of proof?
Answer:The text does not provide an explicit reason for Brumfiel's decision not to use the transfer principle. However, it does mention that Brumfiel is clear about not using it. It is possible that Brumfiel chose a different method of proof or that he wanted to emphasize a more direct approach to inferring truth in real closed fields. Without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
### Category: boole
Question: How does Boole categorize propositions in his General Method and how does this compare to Aristotle's categorization?
Answer:Boole divides propositions into two kinds in his General Method: primary and secondary propositions. This is similar to Aristotle's division but not identical. Primary propositions in Boole's system correspond to Aristotle's categorical propositions, while secondary propositions correspond to hypothetical propositions in Aristotle's system.
### Category: chinese-change
Question: What is the message conveyed by the downfall of the arrogant dragon in hexagram Qian?
Answer:The downfall of the arrogant dragon in hexagram Qian suggests hubris, warning of the danger of excessive human pride in making strenuous efforts to pull oneself up. It highlights that despite apparent progress, there is a need for caution to avoid a tragic downfall due to overconfidence.
### Category: fiction
Question: How can fiction serve as a means for readers to discover genuine truths?
Answer:Fiction can serve as a means for readers to discover genuine truths by including statements that are true both within the work of fiction and in reality. This can be seen in historical fiction, where historical statements contribute to an appropriately realistic setting, or in fiction that aims to acquaint readers with morally or politically significant facts.
### Category: simone-weil
Question: What was Simone Weil's stance on revolution during 1936 and what alternative approach did she advocate for in factories?
Answer:Simone Weil eschewed revolution in 1936 and instead worked toward reform, specifically greater equality in factories through shifting from a structure of subordination to one of collaboration.
### Category: quantum-field-theory
Question: How do quantum fields be understood in terms of wave functionals according to the wave functional approach?
Answer:According to the wave functional approach, quantum fields can be understood in terms of wave functionals that map classical field configurations to probability amplitudes, where |ψ[ϕ(x)]|^2 can be interpreted as the probability for a given quantum field system to be found in configuration ϕ(x) when measured. So just as a quantum state in ordinary single-particle QM can be interpreted as a superposition of classical localized particle states, the state of a quantum field system can be interpreted as a superposition of classical field configurations.

### Category: chaos
Question: What does the presence of self-similarity or noninteger dimension in a chaotic system indicate about its energy conservation properties?
Answer:The presence of self-similarity or noninteger dimension in a chaotic system indicates that its behavior is dissipative (nonconservative, doesn't conserve energy), rather than Hamiltonian (conservative, conserves energy).
### Category: bayle
Question: What is the possible reason that Pierre Bayle distances himself from the arguments that emerge from a conversation between two Catholic priests in his text?
Answer:Pierre Bayle may distance himself from the arguments in his text because he is offering a reductio ad absurdum of Catholic fideism based on philosophical skepticism, which he rejects as it would be an instance of Pelagianism.

### Category: kant-transcendental-idealism
Question: Why might Allison's critics assume that he intends (7) over (6) in his interpretation of Kant's claims?
Answer:Allison's critics might assume that he intends (7) over (6) because they believe that it is evident from Kant's texts that Kant himself is making claim (7) rather than the weaker claim (6).
### Category: mind-indian-buddhism
Question: What is the tripartite model of cognition found in earliest canonical literature that distinguishes between phenomenal world, its mode of apprehension, and type of consciousness?
Answer:The tripartite model of cognition consists of the phenomenal world (loka), its mode of apprehension (lokasaṃjñā), and the specific type of consciousness by which it is apprehended. This model, found in the earliest strata of canonical literature, does not directly reject external, mind-independent objects; however, it does seem to anticipate the idealist tendencies of the Yogācāra School as consciousness is considered a causal condition for the appearance of phenomena.
### Category: kant-hume-causality
Question: What fundamental concept does Hume identify as the basis for reasonings about matters of fact?
Answer:Hume identifies the relation of Cause and Effect as the fundamental concept for reasonings about matters of fact.
### Category: logic-substructural
Question: What is the principle stated by the text that describes a relationship between the outputs of a function when given inputs of type \(A\) that result in both \(B\) and \(C\)?
Answer:The principle stated is that if a function maps \(A\)s to \(B\)s and \(A\)s to \(C\)s, then it maps \(A\)s to things that are both \(B\) and \(C\).
### Category: idealism
Question: How does Peirce describe the relationship between the members of his proposed categories?
Answer:Peirce describes the relationship between the members of his proposed categories as one of inclusion, where of any two terms one will be inclusive of the other, and the other will be included in it. (NE §575)
### Category: lvov-warsaw
Question: What is the form of the logic of assertoric sentences in Łukasiewicz's interpretation?
Answer:In Łukasiewicz's interpretation, the logic of assertoric sentences is a formal theory that assumes propositional logic as prior. It uses formulas such as Uab, Iab, Yab, and Oab to stand for sentences like "every a is b", "some a are b", "no a is b", and "some a are not b". The axioms of this system include (a) Uaa, (b) Iaa, (c) CKUmbUamUab (the Barbara modus), and (d) CKUmbImaIab (the Datisi modus). The rules of this system include all the rules of propositional calculus, substitution for term variables, and definitional replacement according to the definitions of Yab and Oab.

### Category: moral-responsibility
Question: What is the main focus of P.F. Strawson's 1962 paper "Freedom and Resentment" in relation to responsibility practices?
Answer:In his paper, P.F. Strawson focuses on the emotions, known as reactive attitudes, that play a fundamental role in our practices of holding one another responsible. He aims to chart a course between incompatibilist accounts committed to a free will requirement on responsibility and forward-looking compatibilist accounts, arguing that attending to the logic of these emotional responses yields an account of what it is to be open to praise and blame without invoking the incompatibilist's conception of free will.
### Category: transmission-justification-warrant
Question: What is the phenomenon that occurs when a piece of evidence e provides justification for a proposition p, but that justification cannot be transmitted to certain elements of collateral information i when those elements are entailed by p?
Answer:The phenomenon is called transmission failure, and it occurs when necessary elements of collateral information i are entailed by p (together with other warranted premises), preventing the warrant supplied by e for p from being transmissible to those elements of i.
### Category: dynamic-epistemic
Question: How can informationally equivalent states be organized in plausibility models with concentric spheres?
Answer:In plausibility models, informationally equivalent states can be organized in concentric spheres by positioning the most plausible worlds overall on the innermost sphere, the next-most-plausible worlds on the next-most-large sphere, and so on, until the least-plausible worlds are placed on the largest sphere overall.
### Category: church
Question: What did Church call the issues that result in outright contradiction, as opposed to those that give rise only to unacceptable conclusions?
Answer:Church called the issues that result in outright contradiction "antinomies", and distinguished them from paradoxes which only give rise to unacceptable conclusions. However, he later began using "paradox" to refer to both types of issues, as it is the current usage.
### Category: ergodic-hierarchy
Question: How can the concept of K-mixing systems be equivalently defined in terms of another type of systems?
Answer:A system is K-mixing if and only if it is a K-system. This equivalence is stated in a theorem by Cornfeld et al (1982, 283).
### Category: category-mistakes
Question: How does the second sentence in a sequence ensure that it doesn't lack contextual information when attributing a color to the number two?

### Category: original-position
Question: What is the motivation of the parties in the original position when choosing principles of justice?
Answer:The parties in the original position are motivated to do as well as they can in absolute terms in promoting the optimal achievement of their many purposes that make up their conception of the good, without regard to how much or how little others may have. They strive to guarantee themselves a sufficient share of primary social goods to pursue their (unknown) conception of the good.
### Category: supervenience-ethics
Question: What would be a sufficient condition, according to some philosophers, to explain the metaphysical supervenience of ethical properties?
Answer:A successful reduction of ethical properties would suffice to explain the metaphysical supervenience of ethical properties, according to some philosophers.
### Category: al-farabi-logic
Question: What is an example of a valid syllogism given by Sextus Empiricus in his book Syllogism?
Answer:Sextus Empiricus gives the following argument as an example of a valid syllogism in his book Syllogism: [unnamed example]
### Category: computational-complexity
Question: How can a proof system be reformulated in the context of complexity theory, and how can finite sequences of formulas be encoded as binary strings?
Answer:In complexity theory, a proof system can be reformulated as a mapping \(\mathcal{P}: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow  \sc{VALID}\) whose domain consists of all binary strings and whose range is the class of all valid formulas. A finite sequence of formulas can be encoded as a binary string so that it is recognizable in polynomial time if \(x \in \{0,1\}^*\) is the code of a well-formed proof. For example, a Hilbert derivation can be encoded as a binary string through a deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time and recognizes the code of a well-formed proof. The mapping \(\mathcal{P}\) can then be defined so that if \( x\) encodes such a derivation, then \(\mathcal{P}(x)\) is the conclusion of the derivation, and if \( x\) does not encode such a derivation, then \(\mathcal{P}(x)\) is some fixed tautology. This reformulation allows us to analyze the complexity of proof systems in terms of their computational power.
### Category: logics-for-games
Question: What is one kind of game that has been connected with logic in recent literature due to its fruitful connections and unusual issues, despite not being designed to analyze logical notions per se?
Answer:Graph games are one kind of game that has been connected with logic in recent literature due to its fruitful connections and unusual issues, despite not being designed to analyze logical notions per se.

### Category: lakatos
Question: What does Lakatos call the development where many philosophers started to agree on certain foundationalist ideas?
Answer:Lakatos calls this development "empiricism" or "quasi-empiricism".
### Category: identity-ethics
Question: What is Rawls' objection to utilitarianism that Parfit aims to refute in Reasons and Persons?
Answer:Rawls' objection to utilitarianism is that it fails to take seriously the distinction between persons by controversially jettisoning interpersonal distributive principles in exactly the way we uncontroversially jettison them intrapersonally, thus conflating different persons into one. Parfit argues that if this objection depends on a hard-and-fast metaphysical distinction between persons that depends on the further fact of identity, and if this fact is non-existent due to reductionism, then the distinction is nothing to take seriously in the first place. Consequently, utilitarians may be reductionists who can justifiably ignore the distinctness between persons.
### Category: situations-semantics
Question: What is the relationship between the naïve minimalization accounts of donkey sentences within a possibilistic situation semantics and the exemplification account?
Answer:The naïve minimalization accounts of donkey sentences within a possibilistic situation semantics are close to correct, with only a few exceptions involving atelic antecedents. Once possible maximalizations are factored into sentence denotations, the exemplification account coincides with the naïve minimalization account in most cases.
### Category: logic-algebraic-propositional
Question: What is the role of the 0-ary connective in the given logical system, and why isn't there a specific axiom schema dealing with it?
Answer:The 0-ary connective 0 is used as a definition for negation through the formula \(\neg \phi := \phi \rightarrow 0\). Its absence from a specific axiom schema suggests that its properties may be derived from other axioms or schemas within the system, or that it may be considered an undefined element of the logic. The specifics of this choice would depend on the context and the broader design of the logical system in question.
### Category: feminism-psychoanalysis
Question: What must human beings undergo in the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex in order to achieve a sexual position?
Answer:In the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a sexual position by submitting to castration, also called the phallic function, and thereby entering into signification.

### Category: emotion
Question: What are two main types of evaluative theories of emotions, also known as cognitive theories of emotions?
Answer:Constitutive theories of emotions state that emotions are cognitions or evaluations of particular kinds, while causal theories of emotions state that emotions are caused by cognitions or evaluations of particular kinds. These two types of theories represent the dominant approaches in philosophy and psychology, respectively.
### Category: health-disease
Question: What is the view of disability according to the social model?
Answer:According to the social model of disability, disability is seen as a mere difference rather than a departure from normal human functioning that makes an atypical condition a bad difference from the norm. It is the way society is set up that makes people with disabilities worse off, not the physical impairment itself. Disability is viewed as variation, analogous to features like sexuality, gender, and race. The social model was pushed by disability activists who defined disability as the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization that takes little or no account of people who have physical impairments and thus excludes them from participation in the mainstream of social activities.
### Category: goedel-incompleteness
Question: What was Gödel's initial aim that led him to discover his incompleteness theorem?
Answer:Gödel initially aimed to contribute to Hilbert's program by proving the consistency of analysis (or second-order arithmetic) using only arithmetic resources. In this attempt, he needed the notion of truth, which eventually led him to face paradoxes such as the Liar paradox, ultimately concluding that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. This realization led to his version of the undefinability of truth theorem, which then yielded a weak version of the incompleteness result.
### Category: patriotism
Question: What ethical theory emphasizes that moral actions are those that result in the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people?
Answer:Consequentialism is the ethical theory that emphasizes that moral actions are those that result in the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people.
### Category: game-theory
Question: What is one reason why not all Nash equilibria (NE) in non-zero-sum games may be considered plausible as solutions that strategically alert players would choose?
Answer:One reason is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria in such games, and not all of them may be equally likely or rational outcomes for the players involved.
### Category: berlin
Question: How did Berlin differentiate between two forms of 'political realism'?
Answer:Berlin distinguished between a correct perception of reality in politics, which is free from emotional distortions, and another 'more sinister' sense of the term associated with people who admit to being 'realists' and use it to explain away mean or brutal decisions. This second form of 'political realism' scornfully disregards moral ideals or scruples and embraces dubious means to achieve desired ends.
### Category: quantification
Question: What kind of logical system has Soundness, Completeness, Compactness, and Löwenheim-Skolem theorems associated with it?
Answer:Classical quantificational logic with identity is the logical system that has Soundness, Completeness, Compactness, and Löwenheim-Skolem theorems associated with it.
### Category: metaphysics-massexpress
Question: How might the grammatical similarity between terms in category (a) and (b) potentially impact the metaphysical significance of concrete mass nouns?
Answer:The grammatical similarity between terms in category (a) and (b) could potentially undermine the contention that concrete mass nouns have metaphysical import. This is because the lack of grammatical difference between the two categories may suggest that they do not refer to distinct metaphysical categories of objects.
### Category: feminism-epistemology
Question: What is one internal critique of feminist theories that has been highlighted by women of color and lesbian women?
Answer:One internal critique of feminist theories that has been highlighted by women of color and lesbian women is that mainstream feminist theories have ignored their problems and perspectives.
### Category: game-theory
Question: What is the logical form of the relationship between words and their referents, according to the mentioned philosopher?
Answer:The relationship between words and their referents has the logical form of a coordination game, according to the mentioned philosopher. This means that while particular conventions, such as which word refers to which object, may be arbitrary, the interactive structures that stabilize and maintain these conventions are not arbitrary.
### Category: content-causal
Question: How does the Best Test Theory (BTT) handle the issue of "brain interventions" such as LSD, microelectrodes, or brain tumors?
Answer:The BTT addresses the problem of brain interventions through several lines of defense. Firstly, it notes that such cases generally do not arise for most individuals. Secondly, it limits causal efficiency to natural kinds, potentially excluding microelectrodes and leaving the status of brain tumors uncertain. Lastly, it proposes that LSD and brain tumors may act on the brain diffusely, not triggering specific mental representations frequently enough to become their meanings. This strategy parallels Rupert's approach to prevent mental symbols from meaning omnipresent but non-specific causes such as the heart.

### Category: economics
Question: What is the seminal contribution of Kenneth Arrow in social choice theory?
Answer:Kenneth Arrow's seminal contribution in social choice theory is his impossibility theorem (1963, 1967), which explores the consequences of principles of rationality coupled with explicitly ethical constraints in forming social preferences or making social choices. He proved that no method of relating social and individual preferences can satisfy certain conditions such as completeness, transitivity, weak unanimity, non-dictatorship, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.
### Category: rousseau
Question: What is Rousseau's view on the relationship between individual rights and the sovereign's power in a political community?
Answer:Rousseau rejects the idea that individuals associated together in a political community retain some natural rights over themselves and their property. Instead, he believes that such rights as individuals have over themselves, land, and external objects, are a matter of sovereign competence and decision. Individual rights must be specified by the sovereign in ways that are compatible with the interests of all in a just polity, and Rousseau rejects the idea that such rights could be insisted on as a check on the sovereign’s power.

Answer:This philosophical position is often called "direct realism" or "presentationism."
### Category: rigid-designators
Question: Why is the description 'the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky' not considered a rigid designator?
Answer:The description 'the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky' is not considered a rigid designator because its reference can change over time, depending on the brightness of various celestial objects in the evening sky.
### Category: computational-linguistics
Question: Why did Montague treat all predicate arguments as intensions in his theory?
Answer:Montague treated all predicate arguments as intensions in his theory because it allows for the truth of sentences like "John seeks a unicorn" without requiring the existence of a unicorn. Instead, it allows for a certain relation between John and the unicorn-property.
### Category: hist-westphilmusic-since-1800
Question: How does Wittgenstein's view on language change between his early and late philosophical periods?
Answer:In Wittgenstein's early period, centered around his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), he believed that language is only meaningful when it describes contingent states of affairs, making normative or non-factual propositions meaningless. However, in his later period, expressed in works like Philosophical Investigations (1953), he saw linguistic meaning as dependent on how words are used within specific situations or activities (language-games), which vary due to our ever-changing forms of life.
### Category: femapproach-continental
Question: Who is María Lugones and how is her work used in scholarship on trans issues in Continental feminism?
Answer:María Lugones is a figure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been regularly cited in scholarship on trans issues. Her work is used in exploring the intersectionality of race, gender, and sexuality in relation to trans experiences and in challenging cisnormative assumptions in feminist theory.
### Category: logic-dialogical
Question: Did Lorenzen and Lorenz prioritize material dialogues over formal dialogues in their development of the dialogical framework?
Answer:No, Lorenzen and Lorenz did not prioritize material dialogues over formal dialogues in their development of the dialogical framework, despite material dialogues being included from the start. Krabbe interprets the focus on formal dialogues in the standard dialogical framework as a sign of their priority.
### Category: tropes
Question: Why does Ehring argue that tropes cannot have other tropes as parts if their particularity resides in one of those parts?
Answer:Ehring argues that if the trope has its particularity reside in one of the tropes that make it up, we can always ask about that trope what grounds its particularity and quality respectively. Again, we must point to the parts of the trope in question. And so on, ad infinitum, which he claims is a malignant regress.

Question: What is the view of Avicenna's opponent regarding causal connections in a cosmology of secondary causality?
Answer:Avicenna's opponent holds that causal connections in a cosmology of secondary causality follow with necessity from the nature of the First Being, and they are not created through God's deliberation and choice but are a necessary effect of God's essence.
### Category: conditionals
Question: What does Adams's result imply about deductive reasoning from uncertain premises?
Answer:Adams's result implies that if the uncertain premises are not too uncertain and there are not too many of them, deductive reasoning is validated even with uncertain premises.
### Category: species
Question: Why do Dupré, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky argue for species pluralism?
Answer:Dupré, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky argue for species pluralism because of the ontological fact that the organic world is multifaceted, as revealed by evolutionary theory. Their argument is not driven by epistemological limitations or the need for simplified classifications due to our cognitive abilities.
### Category: perception-problem
Question: What is the conclusion of the reverse causal argument using Causal Principle 2 in the context of hallucinations and veridical perceptions?
Answer:The conclusion of the reverse causal argument is that whatever fundamental kind is present in a hallucinatory case will also be present in a causally matching veridical case. So even if v (veridical perception) is fundamentally N (a different fundamental kind), it is also H (the same fundamental kind as the hallucination).
### Category: egalitarianism
Question: How might one formulate an egalitarian view that demands equalizing the condition of all people living from now on, regardless of their past condition?
Answer:One possible formulation of an egalitarian view would require equalizing the condition of all people living from now on, regardless of their past condition. This view emphasizes addressing existing inequalities and ensuring equal opportunities for everyone in the present and future, without being concerned about how people fared in the past.
### Category: qt-uncertainty
Question: What operation do Bhattacharyya, Lee, and Wiseman perform after pairwise comparing quantum mechanical distributions in their argument?
Answer:Bhattacharyya, Lee, and Wiseman take a supremum over all possible input states after pairwise comparing quantum mechanical distributions in their argument.
### Category: skepticism-moral-responsibility
Question: What is one way in which historical compatibilist accounts of moral responsibility differ from non-historical accounts?
Answer:Historical compatibilist accounts of moral responsibility take into consideration how an agent came to be the kind of person they are and the circumstances in which they find themselves, while non-historical accounts focus on non-historical factors such as an agent's identification with their own desires or the quality of an agent's will.
### Category: associationist-thought
Question: What happens to the activation strength of an associate when it has fewer connections compared to another associate?
Answer:The activation strength of an associate with fewer connections becomes weaker relative to an associate with more connections, causing it to be activated more slowly in associative recall processes.
### Category: wittgenstein-mathematics
Question: What would Wittgenstein's response be if he understood Gödel's proof of the undecidability of P in PM on the assumption of PM's consistency, given his syntactical conception of mathematics?
Answer:Wittgenstein would likely say that P, as a syntactically independent expression, is not a proposition of PM, nor is it a mathematical proposition with any intra-systemic or extra-mathematical usability. He might also argue that one cannot make the truth of P's assertion plausible, as there would be no useful purpose for it beyond performing "bits of legerdemain."
### Category: hartshorne
Question: What is the focus of Hartshorne's criticism of anthropocentrism?
Answer:Hartshorne criticizes anthropocentrism out of concern for both God and beings-in-becoming who experience reality in a less sophisticated way than humans. He argues that ascribing feeling to all active singulars does not imply that they possess self-consciousness or engage in thought. Despite this, his axiology remains theocentric in nature.
### Category: vagueness
Question: What type of propositional attitude does Stephen Schiffer argue we have in vague contexts, such as when considering whether a borderline old and bald individual is both?
Answer:Stephen Schiffer argues that in vague contexts, we have a "vague partial belief," rather than the standard belief assumed by mathematicians developing probability theory. This vague partial belief is a unique propositional attitude that he proposes as a psychological solution to the sorites paradox.
### Category: common-good
Question: How does Finnis's view of the common good extend beyond the requirements of justice?
Answer:Finnis's view of the common good extends beyond the requirements of justice in two ways. Firstly, it describes a pattern of inner motivation, not just a pattern of outer conduct. Secondly, it may incorporate facilities and interests that are not general requirements of justice.

### Category: death-definition
Question: What is discussed in the philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and standard for human death in relation to?
Answer:The philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and standard for human death are closely connected to other questions such as how human death relates to the death of other living things, whether human death is simply an instance of organismic death, whether death has an essence entailing necessary and sufficient conditions, if any individuals fall into an ontological neutral zone between life and death, and how our deaths relate to our essence and identity as human persons.
### Category: francis-bacon
Question: What role did mathematics play in Bacon's theory of nature and how did he view it in relation to chemistry?
Answer:Bacon did not reject mathematics in science and was influenced by the early mathematical version of chemistry developed in the 16th century. He saw the term 'instinct' as a key concept in his theory of nature.
### Category: axiom-choice
Question: How can we prove that a choice function on an indexed family of sets exists using Zorn's Lemma?
Answer:To prove that a choice function on an indexed family of sets \(\sA\) exists using Zorn's Lemma, we can show that the set \(P\) of potential choice functions on \(\sA\) is nonempty and strongly inductive. Therefore, Zorn's lemma guarantees the existence of a choice function on \(\sA\).
### Category: truth-correspondence
Question: Why might it be challenging to accept the idea of structure without also accepting some part of correlation?
Answer:It is challenging to accept the idea of structure without embracing at least part of correlation because structure reflects a deeper level of correspondence that builds upon the surface-level relationships represented by correlation. Therefore, endorsing structure implies recognizing some form of correspondence, which is inherent in correlation.
### Category: epiphenomenalism
Question: What is one way that distinctions between mental and physical properties of an event can be made within materialist monism?
Answer:One way to make distinctions between mental and physical properties of an event within materialist monism is explained in section 3.1 of the text.

Question: What was the dominant view in philosophical ethics at the end of the 19th century regarding the definition of moral concepts?
Answer:At the end of the 19th century, philosophical ethics was dominated by naturalistic definitions of moral concepts, especially that of goodness. Hedonists defined 'good' in terms of pleasure, evolutionary ethicists defined 'good' as the most evolved, utilitarians defined 'right' as what produces the most utility, among other naturalistic definitions.
### Category: nishida-kitaro
Question: What does Nishida mean when he refers to the "self-identity of contradictories" in relation to totality?
Answer:When Nishida refers to the "self-identity of contradictories," he means a totality that holds together differences without sublating them into a higher unity. This concept is used to describe the relationship between historical bodies in the one world that differ from one another.
### Category: sartre
Question: What is the significance of Sartre's critique of the powers of reflection in the context of his argument for the primacy of pre-reflective consciousness?
Answer:Sartre's critique of the powers of reflection is significant in that it forms the basis of his argument for the primacy of pre-reflective consciousness over reflective consciousness, which is a central theme in many of the pivotal arguments presented in Being and Nothingness.

Answer:Carnap is extremely permissive in his attitude towards mathematics, accepting essentially all mathematical systems as equally valid.
### Category: epistemology-geometry
Question: What two kinds of knowledge does geometrical knowledge typically involve?
Answer:Geometrical knowledge typically involves theoretical or abstract knowledge, such as definitions, axioms, theorems, and proofs in a system of geometry, and some knowledge of the external world, such as is expressed in terms of a system of physical geometry.
### Category: qm-modal
Question: Why is it usually assumed that the property represented by the projector Pi^alpha on H^alpha is the same as the property represented by Pi^alpha 	o I^beta on H^alpha 	o H^beta?
Answer:It is usually assumed that the property represented by the projector Pi^alpha on H^alpha is the same as the property represented by Pi^alpha 	o I^beta on H^alpha 	o H^beta because of the observational indistinguishability of the magnitudes represented by Pi^alpha and Pi^alpha 	o I^beta. This means that if the Pi^alpha-measurement has a certain outcome, then the Pi^alpha 	o I^beta-measurement has exactly the same outcome.
### Category: logical-form
Question: What is the false proposition that should not be confused with the negation of a statement P?
Answer:The false proposition is the negation of P’s affirmation, not P itself.
### Category: special-obligations
Question: What does Scheffler argue is the necessary consequence of valuing certain types of relationships?
Answer:Scheffler argues that if we have reason to value certain types of relationships, then we have reason to understand ourselves as having special obligations towards the other parties in those relationships, regardless of whether we have chosen to enter or maintain them.
### Category: pragmatics
Question: How does contextualism understand the concept of a sentence in relation to truth-evaluable propositions?
Answer:Contextualism holds that no sentence expresses a complete (truth-evaluable) proposition; rather, what counts as a complete (grammatical) sentence is determined by syntax, while the relationship between sentences and propositions is viewed from the perspective of pragmatics, conceiving sentences as utterance-types resulting from abstraction of all elements except linguistic expressions used.
### Category: epistemology-bayesian
Question: What is another name for the Principal Principle when it is understood as a deference principle to an expert at predicting events?
Answer:The Principal Principle can also be referred to as a deference principle in general terms. Specifically, in the context of deferring to an expert's prediction of events, it is a type of deference principle.

### Category: cusanus
Question: How does Nicholas of Cusa use the teachings of early Christian councils in Book III of On Learned Ignorance?
Answer:In Book III of On Learned Ignorance, Nicholas of Cusa uses the teachings of early Christian councils such as Chalcedon as a background guide rather than providing a straightforward Christology or direct exposition. He continues to interpret and contrast the relationship between infinite God and finite creatures through the contrast between absolute God and contracted creatures, even though there is no real proportion between them.
### Category: spinoza-political
Question: What was the initial reaction to Spinoza's unfinished Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect (TP) when it was published posthumously?
Answer:The initial reaction to Spinoza's Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect (TP) was one of relative indifference, overshadowed as it was by the simultaneous publication of Ethics.
### Category: folkpsych-simulation
Question: How does Gordon propose one can make self-ascriptions of belief without introspection in a simulationist framework?
Answer:Gordon suggests that one can make self-ascriptions of belief without introspection in a simulationist framework by imagining being the other person (in this case, Tom) and forming beliefs in the context of the simulation, which then results in the formation of the belief that (3). This allows for self-ascription without relying on introspection.
### Category: plato-friendship
Question: What is the divine gift of love that Socrates describes in the Symposium, and what does it involve?
Answer:The divine gift of love that Socrates describes in the Symposium is a kind of madness that involves recollection of a prior pre-natal ascent taken in the company of a god. This ascent is triggered when the philosopher falls in love with a boy on earth and is led by his love to ascend by stages to the form of the beautiful.
### Category: reliabilism
Question: What psychological theory about conceptualization does Olsson appeal to in order to support his version of the approach?
Answer:Olsson appeals to basic-level theory, developed by Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s, which is a well-supported psychological theory about conceptualization. This theory focuses on how people tend to prefer using intermediate-level concepts when naming physical objects in free naming tasks.
### Category: curry-paradox
Question: What is the condition that allows the sentences \(t \in \{ x: \phi x\}\) and \(\phi t\) to be interchangeable according to \(\mathcal{T_S}\) in every open sentence \(\phi\) with one free variable and every term \(t\)?
Answer:The condition that allows these sentences to be interchangeable is that there is no object in the domain of \(\mathcal{T_S}\) that satisfies \(\phi\) if and only if it does not satisfy \(\phi t\).

Answer:Spinoza had a passionate and reasoned defense of freedom and toleration.
### Category: legal-probabilism
Question: What is the role of the likelihood ratio in Bayes' theorem when expressed in terms of odds?
Answer:The likelihood ratio is a measure of the impact of evidence on the odds of two hypotheses in Bayes' theorem when expressed in terms of odds. If the likelihood ratio is greater than one, the posterior odds of \(H\) will be greater than the prior odds, indicating evidence that supports \(H\) over \(H'\). If the likelihood ratio is lower than one, the posterior odds of \(H\) will be lower than the prior odds, indicating evidence that supports \(H'\) over \(H\).
### Category: goedel-incompleteness
Question: What is the result of deriving the T-equivalences along with an assumption that formula F is inconsistent?
Answer:Deriving the T-equivalences along with the assumption that formula F is inconsistent would quickly give an explicit contradiction, which contradicts the assumption that F is consistent.

### Category: mohism
Question: What is the hypothetical situation that the speaker presents to argue that inclusion can replace exclusion?
Answer:The speaker presents the hypothetical situation where people treat others' states, cities, and clans as they would treat their own in order to argue that inclusion can replace exclusion. In this scenario, there would be no attacks on other states or cities, and no disorder or injury to other clans, leading to benefit for the world instead of harm.
### Category: computational-mind
Question: What philosophical movement is often presented as a radical alternative to computationalism and typically argues that internal mental computation is not the key to understanding cognition?
Answer:Embodied cognition is often presented as a radical alternative to computationalism and typically argues that internal mental computation is not the key to understanding cognition. Proponents of embodied cognition emphasize continuous links between mind, body, and environment and often deploy tools of dynamical systems theory in their research.
### Category: game-theory
Question: What phrase might indicate that two events occur at the exact same time?
Answer:The phrase "simultaneously with" might indicate that two events occur at the exact same time.
### Category: laozi

### Category: category-theory
Question: What is the current state of understanding of the universe of higher-dimensional categories as a foundations for mathematics?
Answer:The foundations of category theory are still being clarified and there may be multiple ways to think of a universe of higher-dimensional categories as a foundation for mathematics. While we have a good understanding of \((\infty, 1)\)-categories and important results have been obtained in that framework, an adequate language and definite axioms for the universe of arbitrary higher-dimensional categories have yet to be presented. There are ongoing efforts in this area, such as the approach based on homotopy theory proposed by Voevodsky et al.
### Category: proof-theory-development
Question: What is the name of Hilbert's foundational book published in 1899 that laid the groundwork for the central foundational problems of mathematics in the early 20th century?

Question: What do RA1 and RA5 specify about the announcement operator in terms of its truthfulness and epistemic-state-transforming properties?
Answer:RA1 states that announcements are truthful, while RA5 specifies the epistemic-state-transforming properties of the announcement operator by stating that an agent knows that a certain formula is true after an announcement iff the announced formula implies that the agent knows that the formula will be true after the announcement in all states where the announced formula is true.
### Category: paradox-simpson
Question: What is the relevance of altruism in the units of selection debate in the philosophy of biology?
Answer:The evolution of altruism is a central puzzle in the units of selection debate because altruistic behaviors decrease an individual's fitness while potentially increasing the fitness of the group. Examining how altruism can evolve provides valuable insights into the possibility of group-level selection in addition to individual-level selection.

### Category: continuity
Question: What is Dedekind's claim regarding the division of real numbers into two classes?
Answer:Dedekind claims that if all real numbers are divided into two classes such that every number in one class is less than every number in the other class, then there exists one unique number that creates this separation.
### Category: world-government
Question: Who did Emery Reves compare the nation-state to and what negative implications did he associate with it?
Answer:Emery Reves compared the nation-state to the modern Bastille, implying that it is a restrictive and harmful institution. He associated it with threats to human peace, justice, and freedom, as well as with the diversion of funds from important needs, the prolonging of a global climate of mistrust and fear, and the creation of a war machine that ultimately precipitates actual war.
### Category: reasoning-automated
Question: What is an example of an industrial application where automated theorem proving was used for formal verification?
Answer:An example of an industrial application where automated theorem proving was used for formal verification is the Java Card implementation of the Mondex electronic purse protocol. The security properties of this system were reformulated in the Java Modeling Language (JML) and proof of correctness was conducted using the KeY tool, an interactive theorem proving environment for first-order dynamic logic. This demonstrates that it is possible to ensure a fully verified result by bridging the gap between specification and implementation.
### Category: james-ward
Question: Who was likely the philosopher responsible for introducing Ward to the ideas of Leibniz and his monadology?
Answer:Ward likely gained his first substantial appreciation of Leibniz's philosophy, particularly his theory of monads, from Rudolf Hermann Lotze during his time studying in Göttingen.
### Category: international-justice
Question: What criticism does Joshua Cohen raise against Pogge's analysis of poverty?
Answer:Joshua Cohen argues that Pogge's analysis of poverty is too simplistic as it only considers two possibilities for the cause of poverty: the poor nations being responsible for their own poverty, which Cohen finds implausible, or the rich nations being responsible. Cohen suggests that Pogge has not adequately accounted for the empirical complexity of poverty causation and that his conclusions about international culpability for poverty are therefore unmotivated.
### Category: causation-mani
Question: What is the puzzle generated by the contrast between the philosophical criticisms of manipulability theories of causation and the widespread view among non-philosophers about the role of manipulability in clarifying the meaning of causal claims?
Answer:The puzzle is whether non-philosophers are mistaken in their understanding of manipulability's role in causation, or if the usual philosophical criticisms of manipulability theories are misguided, given that many practicing scientists invoke something like a manipulability conception in their work.
### Category: ordinary-objects
Question: What are the five options that eliminativists might consider if it is not indeterminate whether Theseus II is the mended ship?
Answer:The five options that eliminativists might consider if it is not indeterminate whether Theseus II is the mended ship are: (1) Theseus II is the mended ship, (2) Theseus II is not the mended ship, (3) Theseus II is partly the mended ship, (4) Theseus II is partly not the mended ship, and (5) there is no fact of the matter as to whether Theseus II is the mended ship or not.
### Category: pragmatic-belief-god
Question: What does James suggest is the supreme good in the universe according to the first and third affirmations of religion?
Answer:According to James, the supreme good in the universe is the existence of a personal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign, as suggested by the first and third affirmations of religion. The first affirmation asserts that the best things are the more eternal things, which James explains as those things that cannot fail to be sovereign and perfect. The third affirmation asserts that the more eternal aspect of the universe is represented in our religions as having personal form, implying that there is only one personal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign.
### Category: evidence-legal
Question: How do sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative value view the choice of the reference class in legal factfinding?
Answer:Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative value believe that the choice of the reference class in legal factfinding is not straightforward and is open to contextual argument. They argue that data from different reference classes will have different explanatory power, and there is no a priori way of determining the correct reference class. Instead, they believe that the choice of reference class requires the exercise of judgment.
### Category: john-salisbury
Question: How does John describe the way that Epicureanism was later practiced by its followers?
Answer:John describes the later practice of Epicureanism as the pursuit of sensual pleasure without bounds, which he claims broke loose from the crucial restraint of moderation that was present in Epicurus' original philosophy.

### Category: schmitt
Question: What does Schmitt claim about liberalism's approach to conflict resolution?
Answer:Schmitt claims that liberalism has a tendency to deny the need for genuine political decision, suggesting that conflicts can be solved to everyone's advantage through an improvement of civilization, technology, and social organization or be settled by way of amicable compromise. He argues that as a result, liberalism is unable to provide substantive markers of identity that can ground a true political decision and is unable to constitute political community in the first place.
### Category: panpsychism
Question: What is the issue with defining protophenomenal properties as properties that give rise to forms of consciousness?
Answer:Defining protophenomenal properties as properties that give rise to forms of consciousness is too broad, as it would also include properties that constitute consciousness in non-fundamental ways, such as those posited by standard forms of physicalism.
### Category: twardowski
Question: What is the focus of Twardowski's mature theory of meaning?
Answer:Twardowski's mature theory of meaning focuses on the distinction between actions and products of actions, specifically analyzing physical, psychical (mental), and psychophysical actions and their products based on grammatical analyses in a style reminiscent of his earlier work in 'Content and Object'.
### Category: transmission-justification-warrant
Question: What is the alternative strategy for solving McKinsey paradox that assumes a different presupposition of s's cognitive project?
Answer:The alternative strategy is based on the assumption that the proposition Q10, which states that s (or s's linguistic community) has been embedded in an environment containing some watery substance, is the presupposition of s's cognitive project of attaining introspective justification for P9, instead of Q9.
### Category: logic-justification

Question: Why might it be beneficial to exclude a person's own gender from the conception of sexual orientation?
Answer:Excluding a person's own gender from the conception of sexual orientation might be beneficial because it would ensure that a person's sexual orientation remains consistent even after gender transitions, which could have political and moral advantages. This is argued by Dembroff (2017).
### Category: reasoning-automated
Question: What is the relationship between HOML types and terms with their corresponding HOL "raised" types and terms?
Answer:HOML types and terms correspond to HOL "raised" types and terms through mappings, expansions, and βη-conversions. Specifically, HOML types, terms, and logical operators are associated with their corresponding HOL types, terms, and operators through these mappings. For example, if μ is the type of individuals in HOML, then its corresponding HOL type is also μ, while if o is the type of Booleans in HOML, then its corresponding HOL type is σ (shorthand for ι → o), where ι is the type of possible worlds in HOL. Similarly, function types in HOML correspond to function types in HOL.
### Category: game-evolutionary
Question: How are the numerical quantities interpreted in the cultural evolutionary interpretation of evolutionary game theoretic models, if not as fitness?
Answer:In the cultural evolutionary interpretation of evolutionary game theoretic models, the numerical quantities that play an analogous role to "utility" in traditional game theory do not correspond to fitness (in the sense of Darwinian fitness) of individuals, but rather to some other culturally relevant measure of success or value.
### Category: diderot
Question: What role does Diderot's Supplément au voyage de Bougainville play in anticipating the figure of the native ethnographer and generating universal cultural understandings?
Answer:Diderot's Supplément au voyage de Bougainville is a provocative work that anticipates the figure of the native ethnographer by offering an imagined dialogue between Tahitians and Europeans about their different sexual, marital, and familial mores. Through this fictional dialogue, Diderot generates universal cultural understandings by comparatively examining the foundations of morality and civilization in both cultures.
### Category: epistemology-visual-thinking
Question: Why does Carter find diagrams helpful in proving certain lemmas about permutations?
Answer:Carter finds diagrams helpful in proving certain lemmas about permutations because they allow for a visualization of the setup and can suggest proof strategies. By examining diagrams like Figure 9, one can grasp the correctness of steps in the proof and better understand the permutation problem.
### Category: toleration
Question: What position on toleration did Augustine take in his later life when addressing the issue of schism between Roman Catholics and Donatists?
Answer:In his later life, Augustine took the position that intolerance and use of force could be a Christian duty if it was the only way to save the soul of another and if it were used in conjunction with right teaching. He believed that force could shake men loose from the wrong faith and open their eyes to accept the truth. Thus, individual conscience could and sometimes must be subjected to force.
### Category: capability-approach
Question: What is the distinction made by Robeyns between two ways of understanding the capability approach?
Answer:Robeyns distinguishes between the capability approach as an underspecified and open-ended normative framework, which can host a wide variety of more specific theories and applications, and more specific capability theories that instantiate this framework in different ways. This allows for different theories and applications within the capability approach that may differ in structure, purpose, and normative commitments, but all adhere to the same normative core of conceptualizing well-being in terms of capabilities and functionings. Qizilbash makes a similar point in arguing that the capability approach should be seen as a 'thin' framework that can be filled in by 'thicker' theories and applications.
### Category: causation-law
Question: What else is necessary, besides explicitly quoted or paraphrased legal definitions, when analyzing the concept of causation in law?
Answer:Besides explicitly quoted or paraphrased legal definitions, analyzing the concept of causation in law also requires teasing out the implicit concept of cause from its usages in propositions of law and understanding how it aligns with official legal definitions.
### Category: reid
Question: What does Reid argue is the cause of moral evil according to his theory of human freedom?
Answer:Reid argues that moral evil is caused by men who abuse their power and freedom, and therefore they are justly punished for their misconduct.
### Category: eternity
Question: In what context have some physicists and philosophers of physics suggested that spacetime may not be fundamental?
Answer:Some physicists and philosophers of physics have suggested that spacetime may not be fundamental in the context of their work on approaches to quantum gravity.
### Category: settheory-early
Question: What is the name of the concept that is described as "the chain of a set \(A\) under an arbitrary mapping γ"?
Answer:The concept is called the "image function" or "iteration of a mapping on a set", denoted by \(\gamma_{o}(A)\).
### Category: ernst-mach
Question: Why does Mach argue that we do not perceive the world in itself?
Answer:Mach argues that we do not perceive the world in itself because if we did we would perceive chaos. Instead, we have evolved senses that perceive contrasts of perception, or relations of perception, which have meaning because they relate to one another.
### Category: hedonism
Question: What is the term used to describe the phenomenon of being aware of something within one's mind or the conscious experience of an individual's mind?
Answer:The term used to describe this phenomenon is qualia.
### Category: hermann-lotze
Question: Who was one of the earliest influences on Heidegger's philosophical thought, particularly in his neo-Kantian phase?
Answer:Lotze was one of the earliest influences on Heidegger's philosophical thought, particularly in his neo-Kantian phase.
### Category: global-democracy
Question: What is the fundamental idea of the approach that suggests thinking about the principles of democracy rather than treating it as an idealized set of institutions?
Answer:The core idea of this approach is that we should strive for fundamental principles that democracy demands, such as inclusiveness, equality, popular control, transparency, accountability, deliberation, or something else in various institutional locations by various actors in an on-going process. This approach does not demand any specific 'end-point' to work toward and has several key methodological advantages over pursuing models of democracy.
### Category: apriori
Question: What is the pragmatic approach to epistemology and how does it determine epistemic principles?
Answer:The pragmatic approach to epistemology determines epistemic principles by first identifying epistemic goals that we want these principles to serve, then empirically discovering which principles will best serve those goals. This approach aims to uncover the set of rules that, if followed, will result in achieving desired epistemic goals such as having true beliefs, avoiding false beliefs, or having beliefs that make one happy. Intuition plays a role in determining what makes a goal an epistemic goal and what that epistemic goal is, but it is not the primary focus of this approach. Epistemic goals, according to pragmatists, relate to truth, fitting beliefs with evidence, and having evidentially justified beliefs.
### Category: logicism
Question: Is it possible to prove Peano's axioms without relying on any set existence axioms other than those needed to introduce terms of the form ‘NxFx’ and to prove (A)?
Answer:Yes, it is possible to define Peano's primitives '0', 'natural number', and 'successor', and prove Peano's axioms without relying on any set existence axioms other than those needed to introduce terms of the form ‘NxFx’ and to prove (A).
### Category: lyotard
Question: What does Lyotard claim about trying to control and prefigure future events?
Answer:Lyotard claims that trying to control and prefigure future events is an attempt to escape time.
### Category: stoicism
Question: What is the Stoic sage's unconditional desire and how does it relate to duty and happiness?
Answer:The Stoic sage has an unconditional desire to live virtuously, which means acting in accordance with moral duty. In this view, virtue is sufficient for happiness because there is no conflict between duty and happiness; whatever the sage conditionally prefers is always subordinate to her conception of the genuine good. This is in contrast to Kant's notion of inclination or desire, which can sometimes conflict with duty. The Stoic sage's self-sufficiency and independence from fortune's vagaries also contribute to the Stoic conception of happiness. Cicero discusses this topic in his Tusculan Disputations, book V.
### Category: legal-econanalysis
Question: What is the condition that a cost-benefit analysis tries to fulfill in implementing the Kaldor-Hicks criterion?
Answer:A cost-benefit analysis attempts to ensure that there is a distribution of goods Z, derived from distribution X, that is Pareto preferred to distribution Y.
### Category: disability-justice
Question: Why does Schemmel argue that the treatment of people as equals must not be understood in terms of components of individual well-being?
Answer:Schemmel argues that the treatment of people as equals must be understood in terms of respectful relationships among individuals and institutions because the moral significance of respectful treatment is neither exhausted by, nor derivative of, its contribution to individual well-being. People may need some forms of affiliation to flourish but do not necessarily require social and political equality for their own well-being.
### Category: al-kindi
Question: What does al-Kindi claim is the cause of the four spheres of unmixed earth, water, air and fire in the lower realm if there were no heavenly causation?
Answer:According to al-Kindi, if there were no heavenly causation, the elements would never have combined at all, and the lower realm would consist of four spheres of unmixed earth, water, air and fire.
### Category: statistics
Question: What issue does Jaynes identify with the principle of indifference in terms of determining unique priors?
Answer:Jaynes argues that the principle of indifference does not lead to a unique choice of priors because in some cases, we do not even know what parameters to use to express our ignorance over. He emphasizes that ignorance concerning a parameter is not just hard to express in a probability distribution over those values but that there is a lack of knowledge about the relevant parameters themselves.
### Category: qualities-prim-sec
Question: What is the fundamental difference between specific qualia (SQs) and determinate physical qualities (PQs) according to Ortín Nadal (2019)?
Answer:The fundamental difference between qualities of the two types is not that ideas of SQs provide more material for error; instead, they differ with regard to the mistakes we can make about their causes. To judge that a body resembles the sensation of a color is to error about the nature of matter, whereas to make an error about the determinate PQ of a particular object is still to know that it has the determinable quality it comes under.
### Category: pascal
Question: In what area was the controversy about God's grace most evident?
Answer:The controversy about God's grace was most evident in the discussion of free will.
### Category: folkpsych-simulation
Question: What is the focus of discussion in relation to mirroring processes, given the conditions for low-level simulation processes?
Answer:The focus is on disgust mirroring, with the conditions being that a cognitive process is a low-level simulation process if and only if it is typically unconscious, automatic, and stimulus-driven, and satisfies the PROC condition.
### Category: quantification
Question: What is the term Quine (1954) used to refer to alternatives of quantificational logic that allow for a model with an empty domain of discourse?
Answer:Quine (1954) used the label “inclusive” to refer to alternatives of quantificational logic that make allowance for models with an empty domain of discourse.
### Category: facts
Question: What is the type of fact invoked by Armstrong (1997) to deal with negative propositions?
Answer:Armstrong (1997) invokes 'totality facts' to deal with negative propositions. These facts can be designated by expressions of the type 'the fact that X are all the Fs that there are', where 'X' is a rigid plural designator and 'F' a predicate.
### Category: logic-many-sorted
Question: What general statement can be made about properties in relation to their negations?
Answer:Every property has a negation. This means that for every property that exists, there is also a property which is its opposite or absence.
### Category: mind-indian-buddhism
Question: Why does Dignāga argue that perception is radically and essentially separated from conception?
Answer:Dignāga argues that perception is radically and essentially separated from conception because he believes that only perception can provide an empirical foundation and a neutral ground for ascertaining the nature of particulars (svalakṣaṇas).
### Category: substance
Question: What is the concept discussed in section 3.5 that has not been introduced earlier but is related to Aristotle's account of substance and teleology?
Answer:The concept discussed in section 3.5 is the connection between substance and teleology, which has not been introduced earlier but is related to Aristotle's account.
### Category: illumination
Question: Who was Henry of Ghent often referred to as and what was his project?
Answer:Henry of Ghent was often referred to as the “Venerable Doctor” (Doctor solemnis). His project was to defend an Aristotelian theory of cognition while at the same time reviving divine illumination in its traditional Augustinian form.
### Category: philosophy-mexico
Question: Who was Carlos Sigüenza y Góngora and what was his contribution to science and the understanding of pre-Columbian culture?
Answer:Carlos Sigüenza y Góngora (1645–1700) was a prominent scientist, historian, and philosopher who taught astronomy and mathematics at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. He was known for his opposition to the belief that comets were omens of doom and was one of the first intellectuals in New Spain to critically examine the works of Galileo Galilei, Descartes, and Kepler with scientific rigor in his book, Libra astronómica y filosófica (1690 [1984]). Additionally, Sigüenza y Góngora was well versed in pre-Columbian thought and culture and played a role in preserving the moral and political practices and beliefs of ancient Aztecs, presenting them as an example to live by.
### Category: epistemology-latin-america
Question: What is the focus of Meléndez's 1998 book in relation to Wittgenstein's philosophy?
Answer:The focus of Meléndez's 1998 book is to explore the notion of truth from the perspective of Wittgenstein's later philosophy while also considering the conception of truth defended in the Tractatus. He aims to challenge attempts to construct a general theory of truth that would rest on an ultimate and unshakable foundation.
### Category: feminist-social-epistemology
Question: What are the two types of silencing practices identified by Kristie Dotson?
Answer:The two types of silencing practices identified by Kristie Dotson are testimonial quieting and testimonial smothering. Testimonial quieting refers to the failure to recognize the speaker as a knower and offer appropriate uptake, while testimonial smothering is a coerced truncation of one's testimony in response to an audience's inability or unwillingness to give appropriate uptake.
### Category: measurement-science
Question: What is the method proposed by Gustav Fechner for measuring intensities of sensation?
Answer:Gustav Fechner proposed a method for measuring intensities of sensation based on the recording of just noticeable differences between sensations associated with pairs of stimuli. These differences were assumed to be equal increments of intensity of sensation, allowing for a stable linear relationship between the intensity of sensation and the logarithm of the intensity of the stimulus (known as Fechner's law). This law provides a method for indirectly measuring the intensity of sensation by measuring the intensity of the stimulus.
### Category: large-cardinals-determinacy
Question: What is one of the implications of the consistency of ZFC when it comes to determining the property of Baire and Lebesgue measurability of all Σ̰12 sets?
Answer:If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot determine whether all Σ̰12 sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable.
### Category: mental-causation
Question: How does the non-reductive physicalist view the relationship between mental and physical properties?
Answer:The non-reductive physicalist holds that mental properties are not physical, but they strongly depend on the physical. They are "realized" or "constituted" by physical properties.
### Category: conditionals
Question: What is David Lewis's remarkable result regarding the existence of a proposition \(A*B\) such that \(\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \mathbf{p}_A (B)\) in all probability distributions?
Answer:David Lewis proved that no such proposition \(A*B\) exists, demonstrating that conditional probability does not measure the probability of the truth of any proposition. Instead, a conditional judgement involves two propositions, one being the content of a supposition, and the other being the content of a judgement made under that supposition, without combining to form a single proposition judged as likely to be true.
### Category: church-turing
Question: What is the Church-Turing thesis, as stated by Henry (1993), and what kind of machines can be designed to do any well-defined procedure for manipulating symbols?
Answer:The Church-Turing thesis, as stated by Henry (19
### Category: knowledge-how
Question: What kind of knowledge might be transmitted through means other than testifying to the truth of a proposition, possibly resulting in unique forms of epistemic injustices?
Answer:Knowledge-how might be transmitted through means other than testifying to the truth of a proposition, potentially leading to distinct forms of epistemic injustices, as discussed by Hawley (2011) in cases where people ascribe less knowledge-how and ability to female musicians and set higher standards for success due to ability rather than luck or instinct for women and non-white men.
### Category: twotruths-india
Question: How does Candrakīrti's argument from emptiness reveal the unreality of conventionally real phenomena?
Answer:Candrakīrti's argument from emptiness reveals the unreality of conventionally real phenomena by appealing to causal processes at work in producing these entities. It is based on the understanding that the way in which things arise and come into existence definitively informs us about how things actually are.
### Category: practical-reason
Question: How does the narrower understanding of practical reasoning define its output according to Raz and others?
Answer:According to the narrower understanding of practical reasoning, it is an inferential process that modifies our beliefs, including our normative beliefs about what we ought to do. The adjustments in our intentions that result from such reflection are not themselves conclusions of reasoning. Once an agent has figured out what one ought to do, there is no further practical reasoning left to be done on this view.
### Category: meister-eckhart
Question: When was Meister Eckhart elected as the Provincial of the Province of Saxony?
Answer:Meister Eckhart was elected as the Provincial of the Province of Saxony in 1303.
### Category: freewill
Question: How did Epicureans attempt to reconcile freedom of the will with their belief in law-governed atoms?
Answer:Epicureans proposed that atoms, which they believed constituted all things including human souls, can exhibit slight 'swerves' or departures from their usual paths, thereby introducing indeterminism into their behavior and allowing room for freedom of the will. However, it is unclear whether Epicurus himself intended this interpretation or how he envisioned it working in detail. This understanding of his views stems mostly from Lucretius's account in his poem On the Nature of Things.
### Category: skepticism-medieval
Question: What is one of the ways that Henry argues knowledge is possible, based on the reliability of a certain type of experience?
Answer:Henry argues that one can trust the veracity of a given sense experience provided it hasn’t been contradicted by a more reliable sense experience, as one way that knowledge is possible.
### Category: simplicity
Question: How can certain syntactic measures of simplicity become independent of the choice of measurement language according to the statistical approach?
Answer:According to the statistical approach, certain syntactic measures of simplicity can become asymptotically independent of the choice of measurement language by borrowing techniques from information theory. This demonstrates that not all measures of simplicity in the statistical approach are relative to the chosen language.
### Category: natural-deduction
Question: What is Inferentialism a theory of?
Answer:Inferentialism is a theory of semantics, both of formal logic and natural language usage.
### Category: time-travel-phys
Question: Can any constraints be placed on the data that can be put on S?
Answer:No, there are no constraints on the data which can be put on S.
### Category: pyrrho
Question: What is the relationship between Pyrrho and the philosophical movement known as Pyrrhonism?
Answer:Pyrrho is considered the starting point of Pyrrhonism, but it is unclear to what extent he himself was a sceptic in the mold of the later Pyrrhonist tradition. The later Pyrrhonists claimed inspiration from him, but it is uncertain if Pyrrho's philosophy was identical to theirs or if they believed it was. It is necessary to focus on the meager evidence bearing explicitly upon Pyrrho's own ideas and attitudes in order to determine his relationship with his own philosophical contemporaries and predecessors.
### Category: epistemology-evolutionary
Question: Who are some of the key figures in the development of evolutionary epistemology?
Answer:Some of the key figures in the development of evolutionary epistemology include Darwin, Spencer, James, Konrad Lorenz, Donald Campbell, Karl Popper, and Stephen Toulmin.
### Category: decision-theory
Question: Can you name two philosophers who have recently written about the topic of unawareness?
Answer:Two philosophers who have recently written about the topic of unawareness are Bradley (2017) and Steele and Stefánsson (forthcoming-b).
### Category: color
Question: What is the concern of philosophers when they consider how objects appear to have certain properties based on perception?
Answer:Philosophers are interested in determining whether the properties that objects appear to have based on perception are among the ones that those objects are generally agreed to have in reality.
### Category: modality-epistemology
Question: What model does Hale use for a posteriori knowledge of essence?
Answer:Hale relies on a Kripke-style deduction model for a posteriori knowledge of essence.
### Category: reflective-equilibrium
Question: How does Nelson Goodman propose that we should justify rules of inductive logic?
Answer:Nelson Goodman proposes that we should justify rules of inductive logic by bringing them into reflective equilibrium with what we judge to be acceptable inferences in a broad range of particular cases. This means that no rule of inference would be acceptable as a logical principle if it was not compatible with what we take to be acceptable instances of inferential reasoning. At the same time, we may need to correct or revise our views about particular inferences if they are incompatible with rules that we generally accept and refuse to reject because they best account for a broad range of other acceptable inferences.
### Category: vasubandhu
Question: What does the objector argue for regarding Vasubandhu's reinterpretation of scripture concerning the sense bases?
Answer:The objector argues that Vasubandhu's reinterpretation of scripture concerning the sense bases is not satisfactory, as it does not refute the direct reading of scripture that affirms the ultimate reality of such entities. The objector maintains that in order to doubt such an explicit, repeated statement in scripture, Vasubandhu needs to prove that it could not be interpreted directly, or show that its doctrines are internally inconsistent.
### Category: conscience-medieval
Question: What is synderesis related to according to Philip?
Answer:Synderesis is related to the natural will, according to Philip.
### Category: innateness-language
Question: How does Chomsky argue that language use is not controlled by environmental stimuli according to his review of Skinner's book?
Answer:Chomsky argues that language use is stimulus independent, meaning that virtually any words can be spoken in response to any environmental stimulus, depending on one's state of mind.
### Category: nietzsche-moral-political
Question: What is Nietzsche's claim about every action in Daybreak and other works?
Answer:Nietzsche claims that every action is unknowable, as stated in Daybreak and other works such as The Gay Science and The Will to Power.
### Category: skepticism-moral-responsibility
Question: What do many philosophers argue regarding the relationship between free will and morality?
Answer:Many philosophers argue that if there is no free will, then there can be no morality. This idea has been expressed by W.T. Stace, Copleston, Murphy, Hintz, Rychlak, Babbitt, and Smilansky, among others.
### Category: vagueness
Question: Why should we not criticize speakers for being indecisive about vague terms' borderline cases?
Answer:We should not criticize speakers for being indecisive about vague terms' borderline cases because speakers lack literal discretion over vague terms, meaning that there is no decision to be made as it is not a matter of linguistic usage. It is comparable to having discretion between alternative spellings, which is a conscious choice made by individuals.
### Category: wilhelm-windelband
Question: What significant distinction did Kant introduce in his Inaugural Dissertation (1770) that enabled him to claim that concepts relate to things-in-themselves?
Answer:Kant introduced the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and spontaneous intellect in his Inaugural Dissertation (1770), which allowed him to maintain Leibniz's distinction between noumena and phenomena while claiming that concepts relate to things-in-themselves.
### Category: logic-massexpress
Question: What is the necessary and sufficient condition for the material conditional 'This is M implies P' to be true?
Answer:The necessary and sufficient condition for the material conditional 'This is M implies P' to be true is that the set [this] is a subset of set [M], and the intersection of sets [M] and [P] is not an empty set.
### Category: structure-scientific-theories
Question: Can endorsing a particular view on theory structure, such as state-space or set-/model-theoretic approaches, necessarily imply a specific perspective on theory interpretation?
Answer:No, endorsing a particular view on theory structure is logically and actually separable from positions on theory interpretation. For example, Suppes and Suppe have different accounts of theory structure but share an understanding of theory interpretation in terms of a hierarchy of models.
### Category: william-jevons
Question: What is one of the forms of inference that Jevons mentions, which involves substituting similars in certain premises to arrive at logical conclusions?
Answer:Direct inference is one of the forms of inference mentioned by Jevons, which involves applying the substitution of similars to certain premises in order to arrive at logical conclusions.
### Category: blame
Question: What is the issue with hypocritical blame, according to Scanlon's perspective?
Answer:Hypocritical blame is problematic because it is unfitting or untrue to the facts. It distorts the facts by suggesting that the blamee's unwillingness to act in certain ways impairs the moral relationship when, in fact, it is the hypocritical blamer's past attitudes and actions that have already impaired the relationship, according to Scanlon's viewpoint.
### Category: independence-large-cardinals
Question: What are two categories of sentences in set theory, and what are some characteristics of each category?
Answer:In set theory, there are two main categories of sentences. The first category consists of sentences that are similar to the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), in which both ZFC+φ and ZFC+¬φ lie in the degree of ZFC. The second category is comprised of sentences that are similar to the Plank's Length Mathematical Conjecture (PM), where one of ZFC+φ and ZFC+¬φ lies in the degree of ZFC while the other lies in the degree of an extension of ZFC via a large cardinal axiom.
### Category: territorial-rights
Question: What criteria does Avery Kolers use to define an 'ethnogeographic community' in his book Land, Conflict and Justice?
Answer:An 'ethnogeographic community' is defined by Avery Kolers as a group of people that share both a specific social ontology of land (a culturally specific conception of land, what land is, what about it is valuable) and a specific material relationship with land (pervasive material interaction between the land and the community).
### Category: feminism-gender
Question: How does Witt define social individuality in relation to self-consciousness and social positions?
Answer:According to Witt, social individuality is defined in terms of the extrinsic feature of occupying a social position, which depends for its existence on a social world. This is in contrast to personhood, which she defines in terms of intrinsic psychological states of self-awareness and self-consciousness. Social individuals are those who occupy social positions synchronically and diachronically, and they are bound by social normativity, which differs from biological normativity in that it requires recognition by others and can differ from one culture to the next.
### Category: perception-contents
Question: What is the dominant conception of perceptual contents in recent philosophical literature on perception?
Answer:The dominant conception of perceptual contents in recent philosophical literature on perception is that the contents of an experience are the conditions of accuracy associated with it, which is also called 'the contents of experience'.
### Category: closure-epistemic
Question: What must Nozick deny in order to maintain his rejection of K and his acceptance of closure across equivalence, while avoiding the ability to know not-mule through simplification?
Answer:Nozick must deny closure across simplification in order to maintain his rejection of K and his acceptance of closure across equivalence, while avoiding the ability to know not-mule through simplification.
### Category: global-democracy
Question: Who are the main theorists that realists and neo-realists point to when arguing that states are the fundamental units of world politics and that power is the main currency of transnational interaction?
Answer:Realists and neo-realists often point to Morgenthau, as well as Hobbes, when arguing that states are the fundamental units of world politics and that power is the main currency of transnational interaction. They draw parallels between Hobbes's state of nature and the anarchical nature of international politics to support their claims.
### Category: freedom-association
Question: What responsibilities does Tommie Shelby argue that individuals have towards their own communities in deeply unjust societies?
Answer:Tommie Shelby argues that individuals have associative duties and solidarities towards their own communities in deeply unjust societies. These responsibilities come with living in and belonging to these communities.
### Category: plural-quant
Question: How does the Fregean tradition connect the notion of ontological commitment to semantic value?
Answer:According to the Fregean tradition, ontological commitment is connected to semantic value in that each plural term has some objects as its semantic value, just as each singular term has one object as its semantic value. If plural expressions incur commitment to plural entities, then the truth of a sentence requires there to be some semantic value of the sort appropriate to plural expressions.
### Category: francois-barre
Question: What does Poulain argue is the origin of fear according to his philosophical writings?
Answer:According to Poulain's philosophical writings, fear is not an original state but is introduced as a consequence of some men taking advantage of their strength and leisure to subjugate others. He does not argue that this desire for self-preservation and an equal right to everything necessary to achieve it is in itself the origin of constant confrontations and fear raised by these confrontations.
### Category: arabic-islamic-phil-math
Question: Who was the philosopher who discussed the nature of undecidable problems in geometry and whose work on this topic is considered mature in this area of study?
Answer:Ibn al-Haytham discussed the nature of undecidable problems in geometry and his work on this topic, titled "Fī al-taḥlīl wa al-tarkīb (On Analysis and Synthesis)", is considered mature in this area of study.

Question: Who were some philosophers that adopted the Ramsey approach in their work?
Answer:Some philosophers that adopted the Ramsey approach in their work include David Lewis, Frank Jackson, and David Chalmers. These philosophers used the approach in different ways and in different contexts, such as in their work on metaphysics and conceptual analysis.
### Category: meaning-normativity
Question: Why do anti-normativists argue that the term "correct" should not be interpreted normatively in semantics?
Answer:Anti-normativists argue that dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster’s commonly list normative and non-normative usages for the adjective “correct,” suggesting that its usage in semantics need not be interpreted normatively.
### Category: ethics-deontological
Question: What is the so-called "aggregation" problem in the context of moral catastrophes?
Answer:The aggregation problem refers to the challenge of determining whether moral catastrophes, such as a million deaths, are really a million times more catastrophic than one death. This problem is discussed in section 2.2 of the text in relation to deontological constraints and the paradox of aggregation.
### Category: leibniz
Question: What is the highest form of knowledge according to Leibniz?
Answer:According to Leibniz, intuitive knowledge is the highest form of knowledge, where all the components of a complex notion are distinctly known and can be considered simultaneously. However, human beings have intuitive knowledge only of primary notions and propositions, whereas God has intuitive knowledge of all things.
### Category: prop-attitude-reports
Question: What is the name of the account that holds the promise of overcoming Church's translation argument by using a demonstrative that refers to the utterance of the sentence that follows?
Answer:This account is called the paratactic account of indirect speech reports.
### Category: law-limits
Question: How does Hart reconcile his understanding of harm in the context of sexual morality with his other uses of the term, such as moral distress and animal suffering?
Answer:Hart does not provide a clear explanation of how to reconcile these different understandings of harm in his work. He discusses (skeptically) whether moral distress of persons caused by moral wrongdoing of others should count as harm to them, and asserts that animal cruelty should be criminal due to animal suffering. However, he does not offer a coherent way of bringing these various understandings of harm together in a consistent manner.
### Category: logic-linear
Question: What happens when an asynchronous formula occurs on the right of a sequent in proof search as a computational model?
Answer:When an asynchronous formula occurs on the right of a sequent in proof search as a computational model, it can evolve without affecting provability and without interacting with its context. This is because the corresponding introduction rule is invertible. For instance, the agent (\ B ∥ C) becomes (by applying the ∥-right introduction rule) the two agents B and C (now working in parallel). Similarly, the agent (\ B ∧ C) yields (by applying the &-right introduction rule) two different identical worlds (sequents) except that B is in one of these worlds and C is in the other.
### Category: moral-responsibility
Question: What is the argument that both assassins in the scenario have the same moral responsibility since they share same motives, goals, intentions and degree of commitment?
Answer:The argument is that moral responsibility is based solely on internal features of agents such as their motives and intentions. Both assassins aimed to kill, did so for the same reasons and with the same degree of commitment, hence they share the same moral responsibility, even though one was successful in their attempt while the other was not. This perspective is influenced by the work of M. Zimmerman (2002, 2015).

Question: How does the early view of Dainton relate time consciousness to modes of judgment?
Answer:According to Dainton's early view, time consciousness is dependent on the mode of judgment. For instance, one can be intentionally directed towards a past object by judging (correctly) that "Caesar was stabbed on the Ides of March, 44 B.C." The reason temporal differences are considered modes of judgments is likely due to the expression of these temporal differences with verb tense (past, present, future) in language, which also serves to express our acceptance or denial of an object's existence in a judgment.
### Category: sakya-pandita
Question: Why does Sapaṇ, a strict nominalist, argue that cognitive and linguistic objects are not real?
Answer:Sapaṇ argues that cognitive and linguistic objects are not real because they are intertwined with the false reification of the self, which is a cardinal Buddhist error. He also argues that concepts, which are mental objects, cannot be real because they would have to be unchanging in order to be useful for language and thought, but in Buddhist view all things are impermanent. He sees them as mind-dependent, and hence private objects.
### Category: medieval-syllogism
Question: What terms did medieval logicians often use instead of "de dicto" and "de re" when discussing modal sentences?

### Category: shared-agency
Question: What is Ludwig's proposal for avoiding the supra-individual view of joint action?
Answer:Ludwig suggests thinking of the subject term in action descriptions as involving implicit restricted quantification over members of the group, rather than as a referring expression. This proposal, combined with a Davidsonian event analysis of action descriptions, provides resources for an alternative rendering of the underlying logical form of action descriptions that does not encourage the supra-individual view. Instead, it would require that there be some one event for which there is more than one agent.
### Category: value-incommensurable
Question: What standard does Stocker use to evaluate alternatives in an absolute sense?
Answer:Stocker evaluates alternatives in an absolute sense by considering whether they are excellent of their kind, satisfying ideals and standards. This is different from optimization and maximization which rely on choosing the best alternative in a relative sense within a given comparison class.

### Category: qm-retrocausality
Question: What is the view of Russell (1913) on the role of causality in fundamental sciences?
Answer:Russell (1913) argues that causality does not have any role in fundamental sciences, including physics. He believes that laws governing physical behavior in sciences such as physics are differential equations that specify exact properties of systems for all time, leaving no room for causality. Therefore, he advocates for eliminating the concept of causality from philosophical discussions as it is not used in scientific discourse.
### Category: arrows-theorem
Question: What is Condorcet's jury theorem and how does it relate to the epistemic value of democratic institutions?
Answer:Condorcet's jury theorem is a mathematical result that suggests that if individual people in a group have a better-than-chance probability of making correct judgments on some matter of fact, then the collective judgment of a sufficiently large group, arrived at by majority voting, is likely to be even more accurate. This theorem provides some support for the epistemic conception of democratic institutions, which holds that one of the values of such institutions is their tendency to arrive at the truth in matters relevant to public decisions.
### Category: wilhelm-wundt
Question: What does Wundt refer to as the process of synthesizing ever more representations based on compressed or displaced original associative or agglutinated representations?

### Category: frege-theorem
Question: What is one philosophical strategy for justifying the foundations of arithmetic that has been proposed as an alternative to Frege's use of Basic Law V?
Answer:One proposed strategy for justifying the foundations of arithmetic is to replace Frege's primitive term \(\epsilon F\) with \(\#F\), replace Basic Law V with Hume's Principle, and argue that Hume's Principle is an analytic principle of logic. However, this strategy faces the challenge of justifying why Hume's Principle should be considered analytic.
### Category: formal-belief
Question: What is the rule for updating a ranking function when certainty in a particular proposition is gained?
Answer:The rule for updating a ranking function when certainty in a particular proposition is gained is called Plain Conditionalization. According to this rule, if \(\varrho(\cdot)\) represents the ranking function at time \(t\), \(\varrho(A)\), \(\varrho(\neg A) \lt \infty\), and between \(t\) and \(t^\prime\) certainty in proposition \(A\) (and no logically stronger proposition) is gained, then the ranking function at time \(t^\prime\) should be updated to \(\varrho(\cdot\mid A)\).
### Category: gorampa

### Category: epistemic-game
Question: What is an epistemic model of an extensive game in terms of its components?
Answer:An epistemic model of an extensive game is a tuple \(\langle W, \{\Pi_i\}_{i\in N}, \sigma\rangle \) where \(W\) is a nonempty set of states; for each \(i\in N\), \(\Pi_i\) is a partition on \(W\); and \(\sigma\) is a function assigning to each state \(w\), a strategy profile from the extensive game \(G\). The function \(\sigma\) maps each state \(w\) to a strategy profile \(\sigma(w)={\mathbf{s}}\), with \(\sigma_i(w)\) representing player \(i\)'s strategy in \({\mathbf{s}}\) and \(\sigma_{-i}(w)\) representing the strategy profile of all players other than \(i\) in \({\mathbf{s}}\). Additionally, it is assumed that players know their own strategies; i.e., if \(w'\) is in \(\Pi_i(w)\), then player \(i\)'s strategy at state \(w\) is identical to that at state \(w'\).

### Category: ecology
Question: What types of models does population ecology consider, and which type will be given more attention in philosophical discussion?
Answer:Population ecology considers both deterministic and stochastic models. While deterministic population models will only be briefly summarized, stochastic models will receive more attention in philosophical discussion due to their more interesting philosophical issues that have not been adequately explored.
### Category: moral-luck
Question: What do the studies by Kneer and Machery (2019) suggest about people's judgments of blameworthiness in scenarios involving moral luck?
Answer:The studies by Kneer and Machery (2019) suggest that people have anti-results-luck intuitions and lay theories when it comes to judgments of blameworthiness in scenarios involving moral luck. They found that participants tend to judge agents in both scenarios equally blameworthy when comparing pairs of scenarios that only differ in outcome. However, participants' judgments of degrees of blameworthiness vary by scenario when each participant only sees one scenario without a comparison. The differences in judgments were nearly entirely mediated by a disproportionate attribution of negligence to the agents in the harmful scenarios, suggesting that participants may be reading backwards from harm to a morally significant attribution of features in the agents. This implies that it may not be outcome per se that provides the grounds of differential judgments, but rather a distinct morally salient feature of agents that is often associated with outcome.
### Category: logic-deontic
Question: Can you provide an example of a neglected normative notion?
Answer:Yes, an example of a neglected normative notion is when someone complains about something not being done in accordance with a certain standard or rule.

The As-If philosophy attempts to preserve Kant's core philosophical insights while eliminating these inconsistencies.
### Category: testimony-episprob
Question: Why can't young children be justified in accepting their parents' testimony according to Local Reductionism?
Answer:Local Reductionism requires that in order to be justified in accepting a parent's testimony, a young child would need non-testimonially based reasons for thinking that this parent is a reliable testifier. However, young children lack the worldly experience to have good reasons for thinking that their parents' reports are usually true, as they haven't been around long enough to confirm these reports for themselves.

### Category: integrity
Question: What issue do Audi and Murphy raise regarding the use of the term "integrity"?
Answer:Audi and Murphy argue that using the term "integrity" as a standalone moral evaluation of an action or person is too vague and unspecific, leading to what they call the "blunt instrument problem". They suggest that integrity should be used as a complement to more specific moral terms drawn from theories such as utilitarianism and Kantianism.
### Category: fleck
Question: What happens to a thought collective when its thought style becomes sophisticated within more developed societies?
Answer:When a thought collective's thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated within more developed societies, the collective breaks into a small esoteric circle of specialists and a wide exoteric circle of members who are under the influence of the style but do not play an active role in its formation. The esoteric circle consists of those "initiated," such as priests in religion, artists in art, or scientists in science, while the corresponding exoteric circles include lay believers, art-lovers, school teachers of physics, chemistry, and biology, as well as all people interested in science.
### Category: normativity-metaethics
Question: What is the view advocated by Jonas Olson that allows an error theorist to maintain the falsity of both (1) and (2), while avoiding the claim that all things are permissible?
Answer:Jonas Olson has advocated the view that the connections between permissibility and wrongness are best accounted for in terms of conversational implicature, not conceptual entailment. This allows the error theorist to deny that "X is not permissible" entails "X is wrong", or that "X is not wrong" entails "X is permissible", thus maintaining the falsity of both (1) and (2) without saying that all things are permissible.
### Category: liberation
Question: What is the central problem in the philosophy of liberation?
Answer:The central problem in the philosophy of liberation is the issue of the historical subject of liberation, which has been addressed in terms of the idea of the "pueblo" or people.
### Category: johann-herbart
Question: What did Herbart call the total of opposed inhibitory forces in the system of two (or more) opposed representations?
Answer:Herbart likened the total of opposed inhibitory forces in the system of two (or more) opposed representations to an 'inhibition-sum'.
### Category: reliabilism
Question: What kind of correlation does process reliabilism claim between the reliability of a belief-forming process and the justification of beliefs produced by that process?
Answer:Process reliabilism claims that there is a high correlation between process-reliability and justified belief, and between process-unreliability and unjustifiedness.
### Category: logic-relevance
Question: What is the purpose of the paper being discussed?
Answer:The purpose of the paper is to present a unique perspective on what makes a relevance logic relevant.
### Category: biology-developmental
Question: Why might developmental stages be constructed in a way that ignores certain types of variation?
Answer:Developmental stages may be constructed in a way that ignores certain types of variation due to the desire to reduce variation by controlling environmental factors, as well as the tendency to select model organisms that exhibit less plasticity. Additionally, laboratory domestication of model organisms can also lead to a reduction in observable phenotypic variation, although it can also increase variation through inbreeding. Ultimately, the construction of developmental stages allows recalcitrant variation to be effectively ignored by judgments of embryonic typicality, and normal stages can be used as a visual standard against which to recognize and describe variation as a deviation from the norm.
### Category: type-theory-intuitionistic
Question: What is the approach taken in intuitionistic type theory for introducing mathematical relations between natural numbers, as opposed to first-order logic with axioms?
Answer:In intuitionistic type theory, mathematical relations between natural numbers are introduced through constructing new natural numbers using specific introduction rules and defining functions on them using elimination and computation rules, as opposed to adding axioms in first-order logic. This approach provides a desirable computational interpretation.
### Category: forgiveness
Question: What kind of emotional change does Douglas Drabkin propose that God undergoes as an expression of divine forgiveness?
Answer:Douglas Drabkin proposes that God undergoes a change from suffering on our account when we do evil, to feeling our joy and ceasing to suffer when we repent, as an expression of divine forgiveness.
### Category: transcendental-arguments
Question: What kind of view about the mind and world might make Davidson's transcendental argument against skepticism redundant?
Answer:A form of semantic externalism that holds that thought would be possible even if the 'others' with which one 'triangulated' were nothing but robots or automata might make Davidson's transcendental argument against skepticism redundant.
### Category: time-thermo
Question: What fundamental assumption in thermodynamics, apart from the Second Law, is often cited as having time-asymmetry?
Answer:The spontaneous movement from non-equilibrium to equilibrium is often cited as a time-asymmetric principle in thermodynamics, apart from the Second Law. This assumption is prevalent throughout the field.
### Category: genotype-phenotype
Question: How did Johannsen's genotype-conception of heredity view the role of the material make-up of gametes or zygotes?
Answer:Johannsen's genotype-conception of heredity viewed the material make-up of gametes or zygotes as outside the scope of hypothesis, stating that 'the nature of the “genes”… is as yet of no value to propose any hypothesis' (1911: 133).
### Category: watsuji-tetsuro
Question: How does Watsuji understand the concept of 'climate' in his work 'Climate and Culture'?
Answer:Watsuji understands 'climate' in a broad sense as not only referring to the natural environment of a given land, including geography, topography, weather patterns, and flora and fauna, but also as encompassing the social environment of family, community, society at large, lifestyle, technology, artifacts, architecture, food choices, and clothing. He views climate as an interconnected network of influences that shapes an entire people's attitudes, values, and behaviors over eons of time past, creating a mutuality of influence between human beings and their environment that continues to evolve.
### Category: parenthood
Question: What is one concern Gheaus raises about Brighouse and Swift's parental-interest account of parents' rights?
Answer:Gheaus raises a concern that Brighouse and Swift's account does not explain why biological parents have rights to rear their biological children, rather than such children being redistributed to better prospective parents who could undertake their own parenting projects (Gheaus 2012).
### Category: public-goods
Question: What is the characteristic of gift goods that differentiates them from economic goods, according to Anderson?
Answer:According to Anderson, the characteristic of gift goods that differentiates them from economic goods is that their production, distribution, and enjoyment should be governed by norms other than market norms, such as being responsive to the personal characteristics of the receiver and expressing an understanding of the relationship between giver and receiver. Giving money is often considered offensive as it ignores these characteristics of gift goods.
### Category: spacetime-iframes
Question: What is a term used to describe a system of masses bound in orbit around a larger mass that can be treated as if it were isolated in certain conditions?
Answer:A useful description for such a system is George Smith's "quasi-insular system" (Smith 2019).
### Category: spacetime-theories-classical
Question: What is the typical reference body relative to which motion is reckoned?
Answer:The typical reference body relative to which motion is reckoned is often the surroundings of the speakers or the Earth.
### Category: evil
Question: Can a perfectly good being eliminate all evils if some evils are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them?
Answer:No, a perfectly good being cannot eliminate all evils if some evils are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them.
### Category: relations-medieval
Question: Why were medieval philosophers driven to move away from the traditional Aristotelian characterization of relations?
Answer:Medieval philosophers were driven to move away from the traditional Aristotelian characterization of relations because they needed to maintain that things can be self-identical apart from the activity of any mind while also maintaining that self-identity is a relation of reason, and because this position required them to reconsider the way they understood relations in general and God's relation to his creatures in particular. Aquinas's work reflects this shift in perspective.
### Category: world-government
Question: What does David Held claim is the inevitable result of the nation-state's existence in a globalized and interdependent system?
Answer:David Held argues that this dispersion of sovereignty is inevitable given that the nation-state does not exist in an insular world, but a highly interdependent and complex system where globalized economy, international organizations, regional and global institutions, international law, and military alliances operate to shape and constrain individual states.

Answer:Quine's famous one-word answer to the ontological question of 'What is there?' is 'everything'.
### Category: colonialism
Question: How did the Marxist analysis influence the concept of imperialism?
Answer:The Marxist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards economic exploitation led to a shift in understanding imperialism as a historical stage of capitalism rather than a trans-historical practice of political and military domination. This is evident in contemporary debates about American imperialism, which usually refers to American economic hegemony.

Question: What is an example Leibniz gives to illustrate that it is possible to postpone willing an action, A, and that the non-occurrence of A might result from such postponement?
Answer:Leibniz illustrates this claim with an example of the Areopagites who, when having trouble deciding a case, would adjourn it "to a date in the distant future, giving themselves a hundred years to think about it."
### Category: logic-modal
Question: What does it suggest about S5 now that it has been proven sound and complete for 5-validity?
Answer:It suggests that S5 is perhaps the correct way to formulate a logic of necessity, as it is able to prove all and only 5-valid arguments.
### Category: descriptions
Question: In what type of situation does Detective Brown's statement, "The murderer of Smith is insane," pose a difficulty regarding truth or falsity?
Answer:Detective Brown's statement poses a difficulty when there is more than one murderer, and they all belong to an evil cult, making it unclear whether his statement is true or false as it is unclear which murderer he is referring to. This is an example of the residue of the problem of misdescription mentioned by Ludlow and Segal (2004).
### Category: epistemology-social
Question: What issue does a layperson face when trying to assess the performance of competing experts in a domain they themselves are not knowledgeable about?
Answer:A layperson may face difficulty in accurately assessing the performance of competing experts in a domain they themselves are not knowledgeable about, as they may not understand the technical language used by the experts in discussing their subject matter.
### Category: legal-reas-interpret
Question: How does the dualistic nature of interpretation relate to the two senses of legal reasoning?
Answer:The dualistic nature of interpretation, which involves both a backward-looking aspect of capturing the existing content of the law and a forward-looking aspect of supplementing or modifying the law, indicates that interpretation has a role to play in both senses of legal reasoning. In legal reasoning sense (a), interpretation is used to establish the existing content of the law on a given issue, while in legal reasoning sense (b), interpretation is used to reason from the existing content of the law to the decision that a court should reach in a particular case involving that issue.
### Category: epistemic-game
Question: What is significant about the epistemic characterization results of Iterated Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies (ISDS) and backward induction in the context of epistemic game theory?
Answer:The epistemic characterization results of ISDS and backward induction are historically important as they mark the beginning of epistemic game theory as we know it today. They are also conceptually important because later developments in this field build on the ideas presented in this section.
### Category: reasoning-analogy
Question: What is the basis for the goodness of an analogical argument in structuralist computational models of analogy?
Answer:In structuralist computational models of analogy, the goodness of an analogical argument is based on the goodness of the associated analogy mapping.
### Category: laozi
Question: What does the poetic structure of the Laozi resemble more based on its rhyme patterns?
Answer:Based on its rhyme patterns, the poetic structure of the Laozi is closer to that of the Shijing (Classic of Poetry) than that of the later Chuci (Songs of Chu).
### Category: leibowitz-yeshayahu
Question: What confusing situation might arise from Leibowitz's definition of faith as almost synonymous with halakhic observance?
Answer:Leibowitz's definition of faith as almost synonymous with halakhic observance might create the appearance of paradox, as it could be difficult to identify the faith independently of this practice, making it seem like the practice constitutes the faith it is based on.
### Category: broad
Question: Is abduction, when used in the sense of explaining how hypotheses can be justified, also a sufficient condition?
Answer:No, abduction is not necessarily a sufficient condition for justifying hypotheses. It is one way to provide justification, but there may be other sufficient conditions as well.
### Category: hilbert-program
Question: What was Weyl's criticism of Hilbert's proposal of replacing contentual mathematics by a meaningless game of formulas?
Answer:Weyl criticized Hilbert's project as replacing contentual mathematics by a meaningless game of formulas and suggested that consistency of a formal system of mathematics is not enough to believe in the truth of the pre-formal mathematics it codifies. He described it as just "the bloodless ghost of analysis."
### Category: disability-health
Question: What is one criticism of Barnes' argument regarding mere-difference claims for disabilities?
Answer:One criticism of Barnes' argument is that she is too quick to accuse those claiming an asymmetry in preventative measures of begging the question. This criticism was made by several commentators sympathetic with mere-difference claims for some disabilities.
### Category: self-defense
Question: What is mentioned before stating a variation of the Trolley problem?
Answer:Consider is mentioned before stating a variation of the Trolley problem.
### Category: leibniz-physics
Question: What is Leibniz's alternative to the Cartesian understanding of physical extension as a fundamental property of matter?
Answer:Leibniz proposes to explain physical extension in terms of solidity, where a body's extension is a result of its ability to exclude other bodies instead of being the basis for solidity as Descartes suggested.
### Category: concept-evil
Question: What is one key characteristic that some philosophers argue evildoers lack?
Answer:Some philosophers argue that evildoers lack barriers against considering harming or humiliating others that ought to be present.
### Category: realism
Question: What is Devitt's main criticism of the constitution thesis, according to which aspect of realism does he find it to be inconsistent?
Answer:Devitt's main criticism of the constitution thesis is that he believes the literal content of realism about the external world is not given by semantic realism, since semantic realism is consistent with an idealist metaphysics of the external world.
### Category: logic-dialogical
Question: What is the nature of the leaves in a winning P strategy for a given formula in the given game?
Answer:Each leaf in a winning P strategy for a given formula in this game is labelled with a P elementary statement.
### Category: alain-locke
Question: How does cultural relativism propose to promote cooperation between value groups?
Answer:According to cultural relativism, fostering reciprocity between value communities through specific, contextualized exchanges can establish a foundation of mutual understanding and appreciation, which can in turn support active cooperation between value groups.
### Category: continuum-hypothesis
Question: What would be the result of having a unique Ω-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the universe of sets?
Answer:If we had a unique Ω-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the universe of sets, it would make for a strong case for new axioms completing the axioms of ZFC and large cardinal axioms. This would provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of set theory and potentially resolve some of its open questions.
### Category: physics-Rpcc
Question: In what context do the terms X and Y represent random variables that can be correlated with each other?
Answer:In probability and statistics, X and Y are often used to denote random variables that can have a correlation between their values, indicating a relationship between them based on their observed data points.
### Category: heraclitus
Question: Why is Heraclitus considered as the first humanist in philosophy despite his elitist attitude towards humanity?
Answer:Heraclitus is considered as the first humanist in philosophy because he emphasizes human affairs and the human relevance of philosophical theories, despite his elitist attitude that only select readers can benefit from his teachings and his use of literary form to distance himself from the reader. His focus on human affairs sets him apart from his predecessors who mainly focused on cosmic and physical theories.
### Category: scientific-method
Question: Why might it be challenging to provide a unified account of scientific method due to the variability of scientific activity?
Answer:It can be challenging to provide a unified account of scientific method due to the wide variation in scientific activity across different disciplines, times, places, and individual scientists. Any attempt to capture all of these variations in a single account may result in either overwhelming descriptive detail or trivial generalizations.
### Category: medieval-syllogism
Question: What is the name of the first valid mood in syllogistic logic that involves an A proposition followed by another A or I proposition, which results in an A proposition?
Answer:The name of this valid mood is Barbara.
### Category: probability-medieval-renaissance
Question: Why was probability-related reasoning important in medieval thought?
Answer:Probability-related reasoning was important in medieval thought because it played an enormous role in regulating everyday conduct and many arts and sciences. It was also necessary in fields such as jurisprudence, theology, and medicine where claims could not be derived with certainty from indubitable premises. Additionally, the notorious disagreements between scholastic academics required probable reasoning where disagreement was licit and impossible to extinguish by argument. Probable reasoning was also used in the guidance of human conduct by confessors in matters of decision in conditions of uncertainty.
### Category: phil-multimodallogic
Question: What problem might arise if an agent's beliefs were based solely on having evidence supporting those beliefs, according to a straightforward idea?
Answer:A problem that might arise if an agent's beliefs were based solely on having evidence supporting those beliefs is that it would allow the agent to have contradictory beliefs, as two pieces of evidence might contradict themselves. Additionally, this would be a 'lazy' approach as the agent would not be doing any 'reasoning' with her collected evidence.
### Category: qm-consistent-histories
Question: What is the paradox in quantum mechanics presented by Aharonov and Vaidman that is similar to Bell-Kochen-Specker, but involves quantum dynamics and incommensurate families of histories?
Answer:The three-box paradox of Aharonov and Vaidman is a paradox in quantum mechanics that is similar to Bell-Kochen-Specker, but involves quantum dynamics and incommensurate families of histories. The paradox is resolved by applying the single framework rule, which states that a contradiction can only be reached by violating quantum rules of reasoning.
### Category: causation-mani
Question: What kind of probabilities does the connection between free agency and causation support in the probabilistic analysis of causation?
Answer:The connection between free agency and causation supports "agent probabilities" in the probabilistic analysis of causation, where agent probabilities refer to probabilities appealed to in the probabilistic analysis of causation.
### Category: law-limits
Question: What is one criticism of John Rawls' restriction of public reason to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice?
Answer:One criticism of John Rawls' restriction of public reason to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice is that it is too permissive about important matters of (non-basic) justice and fairness beyond these areas. For example, Jonathan Quong objects to Rawls' openness to perfectionist values in relation to large resources for projects in the arts and sciences.
### Category: ethics-indian-buddhism
Question: What is the view of Nāgārjuna regarding how prisoners should be treated based on their physical strength?
Answer:Nāgārjuna believes that prisoners who are physically weak, and therefore pose less danger to society, should be released early, suggesting that he would prioritize rehabilitation over retribution in his approach to punishment.
### Category: international-justice
Question: What two main criticisms did some theorists have regarding the application of Rawls's principles to the global community?
Answer:The two main criticisms were centered around coercion and nationality. Some theorists questioned whether Rawls's principles could account for coercion in the global context, while others raised concerns about how nationality played a role in their application.
### Category: johann-herbart
Question: What is one aspect of character's objective side, according to Herbart?
Answer:One aspect of character's objective side is its dependence on the child's susceptibility to formation and individuality. Additionally, Herbart notes that children have a disposition towards stability of character, which is demonstrated by their tendency to will similar actions under like stimuli.
### Category: thick-ethical-concepts
Question: What do Inseparabilists and many Separabilists assume about evaluation in relation to the truth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms?
Answer:Inseparabilists and many Separabilists assume that evaluation contributes to semantic content, meaning that it plays a role in determining the reference or truth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms. This is because they believe that T-utterances (utterances involving thick terms) have an evaluative truth-condition, which is necessary for thick terms to challenge a logical is-ought gap and for an outsider who grasps the non-evaluative content of a thick term to have difficulty mastering its extension.
### Category: genomics
Question: When was the Human Genome Project officially launched as a US federal program?
Answer:The Human Genome Project was officially launched as a US federal program in 1990.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: Who proved the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem for both recursive and recursively enumerable functions, giving us the results \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{L}\) respectively?
Answer:Alan Turing proved the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem for recursive functions, giving us the result \(\mathbf{T}\). Alonzo Church proved the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem for recursively enumerable functions, giving us the result \(\mathbf{L}\).
### Category: montague-semantics
Question: What kind of expressions allow the use of negative polarity items, as shown in Ladusaw's proposal?
Answer:Downward entailing expressions, which license inferences from supersets to subsets, allow the use of negative polarity items according to Ladusaw's proposal. For instance, no is downward entailing, and negative polarity items like ever can be interpreted in its scope, as in No man ever walks.
### Category: political-obligation
Question: What is one potential consequence of adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism, according to Horton?
Answer:One potential consequence of adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism, according to Horton, is a root and branch reimagining of our political relations, as it may not be possible to continue talking intelligibly and credibly of our government or our state if we dispense with some conception of political obligation and adopt this perspective.
### Category: walter-chatton
Question: What is the relationship between divine cognition and the natural operation of the world in Chatton's view?
Answer:In Chatton's view, divine cognition is an omniscience that does not interfere in any way with the natural operation of the world. It does not force anything to exist or imply that it already does, and the divine will is not involved in it.
### Category: eternity
Question: Why does the cognitive significance of indexical beliefs differ from that of non-indexical beliefs?
Answer:Indexical beliefs, such as beliefs about "now," "here," or "I," have cognitive significance that goes beyond their tenseless content because they involve a subject's perspective and context. This makes them different from non-indexical beliefs which do not involve such subjective elements.
### Category: moral-epistemology
Question: What potential issue do both methodologies of grounding moral truth in rational choice and in reflective equilibrium face regarding the potential influence of the moral status quo on their accounts of moral knowledge?
Answer:Both methodologies face the issue that moral truth may be more likely than not to reflect the moral status quo, as it is unclear why the most stubborn moral judgments in reflective equilibrium are more likely to be true than those that were revised during the process of reaching equilibrium, and individual preferences in rational choice theory are also shaped by the moral status quo.
### Category: plato-metaphysics
Question: What is the relationship between a property's determinate character in a particular and its corresponding immaterial Form?
Answer:The property's determinate character in a particular is always specific and determinate, while its corresponding immaterial Form is abstract and cannot have any particular dimension. This demonstrates a gap between the non-specific and non-determinate property and its manifestation in the particular.
### Category: chimeras
Question: What issue arises when trying to determine which beings have human dignity based on certain capacities?
Answer:The issue is that if certain capacities are deemed to grant human dignity to human infants, then non-human animals with similar capacities should also have human dignity. Conversely, if the lack of certain capacities in non-human animals negates their possession of human dignity, then human infants with similar limitations in those capacities would also not have human dignity.
### Category: identity-time
Question: How does the modified memory criterion allow us to determine if A is the same person as an earlier B, even if A cannot remember enough of what happened to B directly?
Answer:The modified memory criterion states that A is the same person as B if and only if there is a Q-memory chain linking A with B. This chain can be established through a series of intermediate links where A remembers enough of what happened to someone who remembers enough of what happened to someone who remembers enough of what happened to B, and so on. In this way, even if A cannot remember enough of what happened to B directly, they can still be considered the same person if there is a chain of memory connections leading back to B.
### Category: world-government
Question: What are some potential features of a world state, as described by Wendt?
Answer:According to Wendt, a world state could take various forms, such as collectivizing organized violence without necessarily collectivizing culture, economy, or local politics on a global scale. It may require a structure that can command and enforce a collective response to threats, but it need not abolish national armies or require a single UN army. Additionally, it requires a procedure for making binding choices.
### Category: abilities
Question: What does van Inwagen argue against compatibilists regarding the analysis of abilities?
Answer:van Inwagen argues that the production of an analysis of abilities is not an answer to the incompatibilist's arguments against compatibilism. He claims that the incompatibilist has offered arguments for the claim that abilities are incompatible with determinism, and the analysis of abilities does not address those arguments
### Category: analytic-synthetic
Question: What is a characteristic of logical truths, that ensures that no matter what non-logical terms are substituted into them, they will remain true?
Answer:Logical truths have the characteristic that they remain true no matter what non-logical terms are substituted into them. For example, if (14) is a logical truth, then no matter what grammatical expressions we put in for the non-logical terms "doctor", "specialize on", and "children", the resulting sentence will still be true.
### Category: qm-action-distance
Question: What do EPR think about the correlations between distant systems?
Answer:EPR think that the correlations between distant systems do not amount to action at a distance between them. They believe that the apparent instantaneous change in the R-particle's properties during the L-measurement is not really a change of properties, but rather a change of knowledge.
### Category: skeptical-theism
Question: Who discusses interpretive issues concerning CORNEA in detail in their work?
Answer:Rowe (1996, 270ff) discusses interpretive issues concerning CORNEA in detail in their work.
### Category: biology-individual
Question: What is the focus of the essays in Gerd Müller and Stuart Newman's early collection of essays on evolutionary developmental biology?
Answer:The focus of the essays in Gerd Müller and Stuart Newman's early collection of essays on evolutionary developmental biology is on how organismal form originated and on the evolutionary, developmental, and ecological processes shaping it over generations, with an emphasis on the relationships between basic body plans of organisms over phylogenetic time.
### Category: exploitation
Question: What is Cohen's argument about the role of labor in exploitation?
Answer:Cohen argues that the real problem with exploitation is not that capitalists appropriate value created by labor, but rather that they appropriate some of the value of the products that labor creates. He asserts that labor is the only thing that produces what has value, which is all that is necessary for his account of exploitation to be established.
### Category: reflective-equilibrium
Question: What is reflective equilibrium in moral deliberation and what is its narrow and wide sense?
Answer:Reflective equilibrium is a process in moral deliberation where one works back and forth between a judgment they are inclined to make about right action in a particular case and the reasons or principles they offer for that judgment. The equilibrium can be narrow, where one only considers the specific case at hand, or wide, where one considers variations of the case and refines their principles accordingly. Additionally, they might revise their judgments about certain cases if they do not fit with their growing inclination towards accepting certain principles.
### Category: bell-theorem
Question: What was the outcome of Fry and Thompson's (1976) experiment using a different isotope of mercury and a tunable dye laser?
Answer:Fry and Thompson's (1976) results agreed well with quantum mechanical predictions and disagreed sharply with Bell’s Inequality. They were able to gather data in just 80 minutes due to the high excitation rate achieved by the laser.
### Category: campanella
Question: What do The City of the Sun and Campanella's political aphorisms, which eventually became a treatise on politics and government, have in common?
Answer:The City of the Sun and Campanella's political aphorisms were both written in Italian around the same time while he was in life imprisonment. Later, Campanella translated both texts into Latin, with the utopia appearing as an appendix to the treatise that covered theoretical and practical aspects of politics and government. These works, along with four political quaestiones, constitute the third part of his Philosophia realis.
### Category: logical-consequence
Question: Can Aristotle's syllogisms include more than two premises according to the definition?
Answer:No, Aristotle's syllogisms primarily focus on arguments with exactly two premises, but his definition does not explicitly forbid arguments with three or more premises. However, longer arguments can be formed by chaining together smaller arguments, which would be valid if the smaller arguments are formally valid.
### Category: god-ultimates
Question: What is the approach of Theology Without Walls (TWW) towards the diversity of models of understanding what is ultimate?
Answer:Theology Without Walls (TWW) draws on the diversity of models to understand the nature of a globally shared ultimate. TWW reads the body of models as data and their number and inconsistencies as an interpretive challenge instead of a deal breaker. They aim to explain how it is possible for many or all the models to deliver news of what is ultimate by relying on perspectivalism, a phenomenal/noumenal distinction, the models’ incommensurability, etc.
### Category: daoism
Question: What is the key concept in Chinese Zen related to the idea of sudden enlightenment?
Answer:The key concept in Chinese Zen related to the idea of sudden enlightenment is the denial that any process leads anyone closer to the Buddha-nature, with the understanding that one cannot get any closer—one is simply there and needs to pay attention.
### Category: scientific-revolutions
Question: What is the most discussed account of scientific revolutions in the field of philosophy of science?
Answer:Thomas Kuhn's conception of scientific revolutions is the most discussed account in the field of philosophy of science, known for his controversial claims about incommensurability, rationality, objectivity, progress, and realism.
### Category: zabarella
Question: Did Zabarella consider Aristotle's works as a complete corpus to which nothing could be added?
Answer:No, Zabarella did not consider Aristotle's works as a complete corpus to which nothing could be added. He acknowledged the importance of the subject of minerals and recognized that later philosophers such as Theophrastus and Albertus Magnus had made contributions to this subject.
### Category: prediction-accommodation
Question: What is the difference between Penny Predictor's and Annie Accommodator's approach in proposing their theories in Hitchcock and Sober's example?
Answer:In Hitchcock and Sober's example, Penny Predictor proposes her theory Tp based on an initial segment of the data D1 and then predicts the remaining data D2 with a high degree of accuracy. On the other hand, Annie Accommodator proposes her theory Ta after having all the data D available and accommodates the data in her theory.
### Category: bayes-theorem
Question: What are the two main factors that determine the differences between various measures of total evidence in favor of a hypothesis?
Answer:The two main factors that determine the differences between various measures of total evidence in favor of a hypothesis are whether total evidence is measured in terms of probabilities or odds, and whether disparities in total evidence are captured as ratios or differences.
### Category: abstract-objects
Question: Are there any examples of concrete objects that are considered abstract objects?
Answer:Yes, there are examples of concrete objects that are considered abstract objects, such as impure sets, the Undergraduate Class of 2020, The Ethics Committee, and the object London in the Sherlock Holmes stories.
### Category: xenocrates
Question: What are two sources of Democritean fragments?
Answer:Heinze 1892 and Isnardi Parente 1982 are two sources of Democritean fragments.
### Category: computer-science
Question: What is the purpose of tracing back the fault (or 'bug') in software testing after detecting miscomputations?
Answer:The purpose of tracing back the fault in software testing after detecting miscomputations is to provide an explanation of the observed miscomputation before proceeding to the debugging phase and then testing the system again.
### Category: causation-regularity
Question: Why might some defenders of the regularity theory posit natural properties that carve nature at its joints?
Answer:Some defenders of the regularity theory might posit natural properties that carve nature at its joints in order to solve the problem of dependence on epistemic components and ensure that the lawlike regularities are free of them. These natural properties would provide a fully objective classification, but what is natural can be difficult to define and is often simply posited as a primitive that is not analyzed further.

### Category: free-rider
Question: What is the positive outcome of the invisible hand's action on society in Adam Smith's argument?
Answer:According to Adam Smith's argument, when individuals pursue their own interests, they often promote society's interests more effectively than when they intentionally try to benefit society. The invisible hand leads to unintended positive outcomes through competition and innovation.
### Category: transcendentals-medieval
Question: What is the significance of identifying the first known with the proper object of the intellect, as proposed by Thomas Aquinas in his commentary on Boethius’ De trinitate?
Answer:Identifying the first known with the proper object of the intellect indicates that what is most common and self-evident in conceptual cognition is so because it represents the formal aspect of intelligibility, which is included in all knowledge and about which the intellect cannot be uncertain. This means that such an element sets the horizon of cognition and was an important move in medieval debates on knowledge.
### Category: wilson
Question: What did Cook Wilson argue against in his polemics against idealism regarding the traditional theory of judgement?
Answer:Cook Wilson argued against the traditional theory of judgement that one finds in Bradley's Principles of Logic, where judgement is divided into 'judgement' and 'inference'. He claimed that following 'ordinary usage' in adopting a 'judicial' account of 'judgement' is more accurate.
### Category: experimental-moral
Question: What is the argument that the objection to experimental moral philosophy assumes about the nature of moral philosophy?
Answer:The argument is that moral philosophy is a normative enterprise that is concerned with how we ought to be and what we ought to do, rather than how we are and what we do. Therefore, it is unaffected by empirical results. This implies that the objection assumes moral philosophy to be prescriptive in nature, rather than descriptive.
### Category: logic-justification
Question: What are the names of the two basic operations on justification terms as introduced in Section 2.2?
Answer:The two basic operations on justification terms as introduced in Section 2.2 are \(\cdot\) and +.
### Category: ethics-ancient
Question: Why is understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way nature arranges the whole universe essential in Stoicism?
Answer:Understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way nature arranges the whole universe is essential in Stoicism because this knowledge forms the basis for living in agreement with the government of the universe (nature), allowing one to make decisions and take actions that align with Zeus's or nature's plans, contributing to the overall good.
### Category: gasset
Question: What event marked Ortega's serious study of phenomenology in 1912?
Answer:Ortega's serious study of phenomenology in 1912 was marked by his writing of a long review of Heinrich Hoffman’s dissertation, Studies on the Concept of Sensation.
### Category: compositionality
Question: What does the principle of compositionality of reference and meaning require in terms of syntactic rules and semantic functions?
Answer:The principle of compositionality of reference and meaning requires that each application of each syntactic rule within a language be matched by an application of an appropriate semantic function. This is known as local distributive language-bound compositionality.
### Category: levels-org-biology
Question: Why does Kitcher argue that molecular genetics cannot reduce classical Mendelian genetics?
Answer:Kitcher argues that molecular genetics cannot reduce classical Mendelian genetics because molecular constituents do not capture the causal relations between Mendelian constituents (such as chromosomes) and heritable traits. This is due to the fact that cytological processes that form the basis for Mendelian patterns of heredity (such as meiosis) constitute a natural kind that cannot be delineated at the molecular level.
### Category: maimonides
Question: What is the suggested explanation for phenomena in the heavens if they are not necessary and eternal?
Answer:The suggested explanation is that God created the world as a result of a free choice and fashioned it in a particular way.
### Category: teleological-arguments
Question: What provides stronger evidence of intentional design, complexity or an engraved sentence?
Answer:An engraved sentence provides stronger evidence of intentional design than mere complexity in an artifact.
### Category: kant-religion
Question: How might Kant's discussions of God be categorized according to the spheres of transcendental philosophy and metaphysics as presented in Opus Postumum?
Answer:Kant's discussions of God could potentially be divided into two spheres in his philosophy. One sphere is transcendental philosophy proper, which focuses on the formal conditions of metaphysics and includes ideals necessary for positing ourselves in the world (such as God, the world, and man-in-the-world). The other sphere is metaphysics, which applies transcendental philosophy to specific objects. If this interpretation is correct, Kant might not be rejecting his prior philosophy of religion but instead adding a new layer to it.
### Category: hobbes-moral
Question: What does Hobbes assume about people's tendency to make evaluative judgments?
Answer:Hobbes assumes that people use seemingly impersonal terms like ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to stand for their own personal preferences when making evaluative judgments. This reflects his belief that people's judgments are often influenced by their own self-interest and biases.
### Category: ibn-kammuna
Question: What is the role of intuition in the epistemology of Ishraqi philosophy?
Answer:In Ishraqi philosophy, intuition is considered the basis of its epistemology. It is described as an event that yields knowledge swiftly and certainly. This is evident in al-Talwīḥāt, one of Suhrawardi's writings, where intuition plays a major role.

### Category: feminism-objectification
Question: What is one of the reasons given by Langton for why the norm of Assumed Objectivity is problematic?
Answer:One reason given by Langton for why the norm of Assumed Objectivity is problematic is that it yields false beliefs, beliefs which do not fit the world at all, such as the belief that women are object-like by nature.
### Category: skeptical-theism
Question: What is The Inventory referring to in Alston's work?
Answer:The Inventory refers to a list of six disadvantages that Alston discusses in relation to discerning whether there are pointless evils from the fact of inscrutable evils (1996b, 120).
### Category: spinoza-political
Question: What argument does Spinoza give against the idea that humans have their own set of rational, normative laws that govern them differently from the rest of nature?
Answer:Spinoza argues that humans do not have their own set of rational, normative laws that govern them differently from the rest of nature. Instead, humans act in accordance with the same laws and rules of nature as everything else in the natural world, whether they are guided by reason or desire.
### Category: equivME
Question: What type of reaction did Rainville et al. use in their direct test of \(E = mc^2\) to compare the difference in rest-masses with the energy of emitted gamma rays?
Answer:Rainville et al. used neutron capture reactions in their direct test of \(E = mc^2\) to compare the difference in rest-masses with the energy of emitted gamma rays. Specifically, they examined two reactions involving neutron capture by Sulphur (S) and Silicon (Si).
### Category: medieval-syllogism
Question: What is the principle that, according to Buridan, must hold for a formal consequence to be valid and how does it relate to the terms in a syllogism?
Answer:The principle of uniform substitution is the rule that, according to Buridan, must hold for a formal consequence to be valid. This principle states that a formal consequence is valid for any uniform substitution of its categorematic terms. In the case of a syllogism, which is a special kind of formal consequence, Buridan states that terms must be conjoined across sentences in order for the syllogism to be valid. To make clear the relation of the terms in a syllogism and its validity, Buridan reformulates the traditional dici de omni et nullo rules.
### Category: death
Question: Why might the strength of the argument depend on whether 'death' refers to the event of dying or the state of being dead?
Answer:The argument may be more compelling if 'death' is understood as referring to being dead, rather than the process of dying, because this allows for a clearer contrast between the moment of death and the preceding life. The argument hinges on this distinction, so its persuasiveness may depend on how effectively this distinction is conveyed by the use of 'death'
### Category: future-contingents
Question: What is one characteristic of the truth-value of a propositional constant in this philosophical context?
Answer:In this philosophical context, the truth-value of a propositional constant does not vary with changing circumstances or chronicles, but depends only on the moment in time under consideration.
### Category: phenomenal-intentionality
Question: What is one point of disagreement between eliminativists and derivativists about standing states in the context of intentionality?
Answer:The disagreement lies in whether dispositional states, which are a kind of disposition to have phenomenal states, can be considered as intentional states. Most eliminativists and derivativists agree on the dispositional nature of standing states, but not on their intentional status.
### Category: arendt
Question: What is the activity in Arendt's work that is most closely connected with natality because it allows individuals to re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their birth?
Answer:Action is the activity in Arendt's work that is most closely connected with natality because it allows individuals to re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their birth by enabling them to begin something new every time they act. This is because each new beginning actualizes the new beginning inherent in their birth, as stated in "The Human Condition" (HC, 9).
### Category: heytesbury
Question: What are the two kinds of boundaries of capacities as described in Heytesbury's Regulae?
Answer:The two kinds of boundaries of capacities described in Heytesbury's Regulae are intrinsic boundaries, where an element is a member of the sequence of elements it bounds (maximum quod sic, minimum quod sic), and extrinsic boundaries, where an element which serves as a boundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds (maximum quod non, minimum quod non).
### Category: rigid-designators
Question: What is one important function of rigidity in the given philosophical context?
Answer:In this philosophical context, rigidity does interesting epistemological and metaphysical work, as mentioned in the provided text.
### Category: logic-modal

### Category: wyclif
Question: What would be the result of annihilation, according to Wyclif?
Answer:According to Wyclif, annihilation would result in the total destruction of all levels of being of a creature, implying several absurdities.
### Category: bentham
Question: Who were some of the economists influenced by Bentham's utilitarian ideas and how did they develop his theories?
Answer:W. S. Jevons developed Bentham's theory of diminishing marginal utility into modern welfare economics, F. Y. Edgeworth reformulated Bentham's goal of "greatest happiness of the greatest number" into greatest total happiness, and Sidney Webb applied utilitarian ideas to maximize and better distribute "total utility". Additionally, Graham Wallas hailed Bentham as Britain's greatest political inventor due to his legal, political, and administrative innovations.
### Category: suicide
Question: What two scenarios are being compared in order to make a rational judgment about one's own death?
Answer:The two scenarios being compared are the overall goodness of one's life as it would be if it continued on its present course, and the overall goodness of one's life if it ended before its present course.
### Category: ethics-belief
Question: What is the general consensus among analytic philosophers about what belief is?
Answer:The general consensus among analytic philosophers is that belief is (roughly) a dispositional, affirmative attitude towards a proposition or state of affairs. To believe that p is to take it that p is true—to take it that the state of affairs described by the sentence “p” obtains.
### Category: monism
Question: What is the reasoning behind the claim that fundamental entities must be homogeneous?
Answer:The reasoning behind the claim that fundamental entities must be homogeneous is that if they were heterogeneous, they would be internally diverse and would therefore differ from themselves. Additionally, if heterogeneity can only be accounted for through having many fundamental homogeneous parts that differ from each other, then the priority pluralist has an advantage in being able to account for heterogeneity in this way, as they have multiple fundamental entities that may all be homogeneous but still different from each other.
### Category: names
Question: What is another term used with the same goal in mind as "uniquely denoting name", but with a greater reluctance to embrace genuine homonymy?
Answer:The term "name-using practice" is used with the same goal in mind as "uniquely denoting name", but with a greater reluctance to embrace genuine homonymy.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What can be inferred about the computably enumerability of \(A\), if \(B\) is computably enumerable?
Answer:If \(B\) is computably enumerable, then \(A\) is also computably enumerable.
### Category: conservatism
Question: How do socialist critics respond to Oakeshott's description of conservatism as a disposition to enjoy the present?
Answer:Socialist critics argue that those in poverty cannot be said to "enjoy" many resources at all, and therefore any aspiration they have for big changes cannot be dismissed as mere "fidgeting." They point out that people living in difficult conditions, such as Manchester factory workers of the 1840s or slum dwellers in contemporary Mumbai or Mexico City, would find little to enjoy in their circumstances. As O'Hear (1998) notes, those who see society as riddled with defects are often impatient with conservative resistance to change, viewing the conservative emphasis on human ignorance and traditional wisdom as an evasion at best.
### Category: althusser
Question: What was one criticism of Althusser's re-reading of Marx's work?
Answer:One criticism of Althusser's re-reading of Marx's work was that it ignored much of what Marx actually wrote about his logic and about the concepts important to his analysis.
### Category: attention
Question: What does Locke's treatment of attention as a mode of thinking imply about the need for a separate theory to account for attention, study, etc.?
Answer:Locke's treatment of attention as a mode of thinking implies that once we have a theory of thinking, there is no need for further theory to account for attention, study, etc., as they can be considered modifications of thinking. This is similar to how we don't need an independent theory of limping once we have a theory of walking, since limping is just a modification of walking.
### Category: logic-substructural
Question: What else do structural rules affect besides the conditional in logic?
Answer:Structural rules can also affect conjunction and disjunction, as well as negation in logic.
### Category: pomponazzi
Question: What did Pomponazzi think of Averroes' view that the material intellect is one in number and shared by all humans?
Answer:Pomponazzi rejected Averroes' view that the material intellect is one in number and shared by all humans, deeming it false, unintelligible, monstrous, and quite foreign to Aristotle's view.
### Category: legal-reas-prec
Question: How are three possible ways to understand precedents categorized?
Answer:Precedents can be understood as laying down rules, as the application of underlying principles, or as a decision based on the balance of reasons.
### Category: dutch-book
Question: Why are the differences between various formulations of the axioms not crucial for the purpose of outlining the basic argument?
Answer:The differences between various formulations of the axioms are not crucial for outlining the basic argument because they are mainly concerned with the objects that probabilities are appropriately attached to and the reasonableness of the argument's conclusion. These distinctions do not affect the overall structure and logic of the argument being presented.
### Category: feminism-rape
Question: Why does MacKinnon believe that using a "reasonable belief" standard in rape cases is problematic?
Answer:MacKinnon argues that a "reasonable belief" standard in rape cases is problematic because it relies on patriarchal and pornographic assumptions, and masquerades as objectivity while measuring consent from a predominantly male perspective which does not take into account women's desires.
### Category: neo-kantianism
Question: What is the basis of Windelband's classification of the empirical sciences, and what two categories does it result in?
Answer:Windelband's classification of the empirical sciences is based on the formal property of the theoretical or cognitive objectives of the science in question. This classification results in two categories: one kind of science that is an inquiry into general laws and another kind of science that is an inquiry into specific historical facts.
### Category: physics-experiment
Question: What is a point of agreement between Staley and Galison regarding experimental results?
Answer:Both Staley and Galison agree that arguments are offered for the correctness of experimental results. Their disagreement lies in the nature of those arguments.
### Category: economics
Question: What do many economists assume about preferences in order to take welfare to coincide with preference satisfaction?
Answer:Many economists assume that preferences in circumstances where people are self-interested and good judges of their interests merely constitute good evidence of what will promote welfare.
### Category: location-mereology
Question: What is a consequence if it is possible for both state of affairs s1 and s2 to obtain and for two simples to have identical exact locations?
Answer:If it's possible for both s1 and s2 to obtain, then it's possible for disjoint things (the simples) to have identical (hence overlapping) exact locations.
### Category: realism-theory-change
Question: What consequence does Putnam believe will result from the failure of his third thesis?
Answer:Putnam believes that the failure of his third thesis will lead to a disastrous “meta-induction”.
### Category: preferences
Question: How can mentalists categorize agents in terms of their ability to have preferences?
Answer:Mentalists distinguish between agents who have preferences as states of minds, such as humans and possibly higher animals, and those who do not have preferences as states of minds, such as machines, plants, or institutions.
### Category: religion-morality
Question: What is Heidegger's view on traditional Christianity in relation to authentic existence?
Answer:Heidegger saw traditional Christianity as just one more convention that makes authentic existence more difficult, rather than as a means to achieve it.
### Category: structure-scientific-theories
Question: What is one of the functions of correspondence rules in scientific theories?
Answer:Correspondence rules serve as the glue between theory and observation in scientific theories by providing observational interpretation of theoretical terms and connecting observation terms in the reduced theory to theoretical concepts in the reducing theory.
### Category: genetic-drift
Question: What phenomenon does the Hagedoorns' "random sampling" describe?
Answer:The Hagedoorns' "random sampling" describes the phenomenon where only a small fraction of a population successfully reproduces despite the size of the population remaining relatively constant from year to year.
### Category: descartes-epistemology
Question: Under what circumstances might Descartes be said to relax his epistemic standards in the Sixth Meditation?
Answer:Descartes might be interpreted as relaxing his epistemic standards in the Sixth Meditation by no longer insisting on perfect knowledge and settling for probabilistic arguments instead, although there are no decisive texts that support this interpretation. Some evidence for this interpretation can be found in the Synopsis to the Meditations where Descartes writes of his Sixth Meditation arguments in terms of probability.
### Category: alternative-possibilities
Question: In what context does John Locke use the phrase "imagine that" in his Essay?
Answer:In his Essay, John Locke uses the phrase "imagine that" to introduce hypothetical scenarios that help illustrate his philosophical points. These imaginative scenarios are often used to clarify concepts related to epistemology and the nature of human understanding.
### Category: althusser
Question: What was the reaction of some readers when Althusser revised his take on the relationships among philosophy, science, ideology, and politics?
Answer:Some readers viewed Althusser's revisions as a politically motivated betrayal of his theoretical accomplishments, while others saw them as revealing his project as untenable and self-contradictory. However, some recent critics argue that these revisions are consistent with and necessary to the development of what they view as the overall goal of Althusser’s work: the development of a materialist political philosophy adequate for political practice.
### Category: vives
Question: What is the relationship between the senses and the mind's pursuit of knowledge, according to Vives?
Answer:According to Vives, the senses provide the foundation for all knowledge, as they are the source of our perceptions. However, he acknowledges that the senses have limitations, as they cannot grasp what is incorporeal or hidden. Therefore, while sensory knowledge must be transcended through reasoning, our knowledge of the essence of a thing is only an approximate guess based on the sensible operations of the thing in question, and our judgments can only increase the probability of the conclusion.
### Category: propositions-structured
Question: What kind of entities are structured Russellian propositions according to Soames (1987)?
Answer:Structured Russellian propositions are entities that consist of individuals, properties, and relations as constituents, according to Soames (1987).

### Category: sakya-pandita
Question: What is the relationship between wholesomeness and actions in Sapaṇ's philosophy?
Answer:Wholesomeness is a quality of an action that is determined by the happiness or pain that the action causes in Sapaṇ's philosophy. This is in contrast to the unconditioned, actionless, Realm of Reality or Dharmadhātu which is neither wholesome nor unwholesome.
### Category: anomalous-monism
Question: What does supervenience entail regarding changes in mental and physical properties of an event, according to Davidson?
Answer:Supervenience entails that any change in a mental property of an event will be accompanied by a change in the physical properties of that event, but it does not entail that changes in mental properties of other events will be accompanied by identical changes in physical properties of those other events.
### Category: tropes
Question: Why might one argue that the claim that our perception of a trope is phenomenologically distinguishable from our perception of a state of affairs is based on weak grounds?
Answer:One might argue that this claim is based on weak grounds because it is grounded in little more than its proponent's introspective intuitions, and states of affairs, just like tropes, are particulars. This argument also points out that saying the very idea of something spatiotemporal containing a universal is absurd, begs the question against the view they are opposing.
### Category: al-farabi-logic
Question: What three pieces of meaning does al-Fārābī claim that a verb expresses simultaneously?
Answer:Al-Fārābī claims that a verb expresses three pieces of meaning simultaneously: (i) a simple primary concept, (ii) a copular linking, and (iii) a tense (and hence a time). For example, in "Zayd walked", the verb "walked" expresses the primary concept of walking, links this concept to Zayd, and indicates past tense.
### Category: buddhism-huayan
Question: What is the purpose of Zhiyan's doctrine of the ten mysteries in the Huayan School of thought?
Answer:The purpose of Zhiyan's doctrine of the ten mysteries is to reveal aspects of the Avatamsaka Sutra's vision of reality in the Huayan School of thought, which does not quite correspond with Dushun's ten claims about the "total pervasion and accommodation" of each shi with all others in his third discernment. Subsequent contributors to the Huayan School understand Zhiyan’s mysteries as an effort to elaborate upon these claims.
### Category: heraclitus
Question: Why does Heraclitus see war and strife as crucial elements in his philosophical view of the world?
Answer:Heraclitus sees war and strife as crucial elements in his philosophical view of the world because he believes that change is the very essence of nature, and without change, there would be no world. Mutual transformations of matter, which war and strife symbolize, are not an accidental feature but the core of existence in this perspective.
### Category: frege-theorem
Question: What is the term used to describe the process of drawing a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning, even if that conclusion cannot be proven with absolute certainty?
Answer:This process is called abduction or Inference to the Best Explanation.
### Category: emotion
Question: When did social constructionism, an approach that overlaps with psychological constructionism, first emerge in the field of social sciences?
Answer:Social constructionism first emerged in the 1920's when anthropologists and social scientists started questioning Darwin's evidence for the universality of emotional expressions.
### Category: evil
Question: How might the existence of necessary evils impact the strength of evidential formulations of the argument from evil against the existence of God?
Answer:If there can be evils that are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them, then the mere existence of evil—in the absence of further information—does not provide strong evidence against the existence of God, as it could be part of an overall greater good that is not immediately comprehensible to humans. This is because it is challenging to formulate a solid evidential argument against God's existence based solely on the existence of evil without taking into account possible necessary connections between evil and greater goods.
### Category: logic-algebraic-propositional
Question: What field of study is Jansana's work on selfextensional logics with conjunction and the deduction-detachment property for a single term related to?

### Category: cohen
Question: What is the philosophical view that the mind contributes to determining what counts as an object for us, associated with both Kant and Cohen's interpretations of Plato?
Answer:This view is known as idealism, and it is the belief that a priori laws of human knowledge determine what counts as an object for us. This view holds that our minds play an active role in shaping our understanding of reality, rather than simply passively receiving information from the external world.
### Category: contract-law

The Franciscans taught the philosophy of Duns Scotus, the Dominicans followed the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, and the Jesuits were more open to modern philosophy.
### Category: animalism
Question: How does John Locke define personal identity in the context of identity over time?
Answer:John Locke defines personal identity over time in terms of consciousness and memory; he argues that a person is constituted by their conscious thoughts and memories, and that personal identity is therefore established by psychological continuity rather than physical continuity.
### Category: truthlikeness
Question: How does learning that electrons are fundamental assist in getting closer to the truth about fundamental particles according to the given example?
Answer:According to the example, learning that electrons are fundamental edges you closer to the truth about fundamental particles because it provides a piece of the complete truth about fundamental particles, even though it is not the whole truth by itself.
### Category: providence-divine
Question: Why is moral evil not to be blamed on God according to free will theodicy?
Answer:According to free will theodicy, moral evil is entirely our fault because it owes its existence to our wills, not to God's. God cannot endow us with free will without running the risk that some of us, at least, will turn against him and use our freedom to seek evil ends. However, God merely permits our choices and makes them efficacious, and moral evil is to be laid at our doorstep because it is we who choose it.
### Category: ethics-manipulation
Question: Can the concept that manipulation bypasses an individual's rational deliberation be used as a definition of manipulation?
Answer:Yes, the idea that manipulation bypasses an individual's rational deliberation can serve as a definition of manipulation, as it describes the process of manipulation as circumventing the person's thoughtful decision-making.
### Category: turing
Question: Does Turing's work during 1945-50 provide any evidence against Penrose's interpretation that physical effects could be uncomputable?
Answer:No, Turing's work during 1945-50 does not provide any evidence against Penrose's interpretation that physical effects could be uncomputable as there is no reference to this possibility in Turing's technical precursor papers.
### Category: word-meaning
Question: What is the role of simulators in Barsalou's theory of perceptual symbol systems?
Answer:In Barsalou's theory of perceptual symbol systems, simulators are responsible for generating inferences, being combined recursively to implement productivity, and simulating a kind of thing perceptually, thus playing the role traditionally attributed to concepts in cognitive science. They produce limitless simulations of perceptual components by integrating related perceptual symbols stored in long-term memory. Perceptual recognition of a word activates the relevant simulator, which in turn simulates a referent for the word. Syntax provides instructions for building integrated perceptual simulations that constitute semantic interpretations.
### Category: vegetarianism
Question: What does a participatory idea suggest about consuming wrongfully-produced goods?
Answer:A participatory idea suggests that consuming wrongfully-produced goods is wrong because it constitutes cooperation with or participation in wrongdoing. This idea does not imply that Bob and Cece do wrong by not participating in terror since they are not contributing to it.
### Category: necessary-sufficient
Question: What is mentioned as being surprisingly hard to formulate in a natural English equivalent when trying to reformulate (iii) in terms of “only if”?
Answer:The natural English equivalent of formulating (iii) in terms of “only if” is mentioned as being surprisingly hard to formulate. Specifically, it is suggested that coming up with an equivalent that involves “only if” is challenging.

### Category: scientific-unity
Question: What is the role of William Whewell's philosophy of science in the development of the unifying spirit in British natural philosophy?
Answer:William Whewell's philosophy of science played a significant role in the development of the unifying spirit in British natural philosophy through his notion of mind-constructed fundamental ideas, which formed the basis for organizing axioms and phenomena and classifying sciences, as well as his argument for the reality of explanatory causes in the form of consilience of induction. Consilience of induction is an argument that posits that a single cause can be independently arrived at as the hypothesis explaining different kinds of phenomena.
### Category: justice-transitional
Question: Under what circumstances is the International Criminal Court required to consider the views and concerns of victims in its proceedings?
Answer:The International Criminal Court is required to consider the views and concerns of victims in its proceedings when the personal interests of the victims are affected. This is determined by the Court at appropriate stages of the proceedings, in a manner which is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused to a fair and impartial trial.
### Category: neoliberalism
Question: Why might a lack of motivation from those in power lead to the ineffectiveness of a socialist government, even if all informational problems were solved?
Answer:A lack of motivation from those in power to implement a socialist plan could lead to the misuse of their power for selfish ends, which would undermine the effectiveness of socialist government. This is because such selfish behavior would not prioritize the collective good that socialism aims to achieve.
### Category: ethics-internet-research
Question: Who have used the commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics?

### Category: kant-religion
Question: What is the focus of Kant's comment on religious assent according to Wood (1970), Chignell, and Pasternack?
Answer:The focus of Kant's comment on religious assent is on its moral significance rather than ontological commitment, as emphasized by Wood (1970), Chignell, and Pasternack. They base their views on Kant's "Absurdum Practicum" argument and his discussions on the relationship between belief, knowledge, and opinion.
### Category: logic-normative
Question: What is the consequence of having formally incoherent attitudes, according to Kolodny (2007)?
Answer:The consequence of having formally incoherent attitudes is that one must be violating some requirement of reason, as one of these attitudes is at odds with the reason for it, even if it were not part of an incoherent set (Kolodny 2007: 231).
### Category: war
Question: What is the function of the discrimination principle in war, according to the text?

### Category: saadya
Question: What might Maimonides see as problematic about Saadya's speculative theological reasoning?
Answer:Maimonides might see Saadya's speculative theological reasoning as reasoning-in-the-service-of-pre-established-ideas, particularly when it comes to theological commitments. Maimonides criticizes this kind of 'reasoning' as a fanciful, non-philosophical mode of pseudo-reasoning in his critique of Kalam.
### Category: ibn-rushd-natural
Question: What is Aristotle's view on the necessity of an unmoved mover for something at rest?
Answer:Aristotle holds that if something is at rest because something else has stopped moving, that thing must be moved by something. This implies that there is a need for an unmoved mover in his perspective.

### Category: psychologism
Question: What is Richard Kroner's view on the foundation of logical laws and their associated 'ought-sentences'?
Answer:Richard Kroner argued that logical laws are imperatives founded on values, and not all 'ought-sentences' are based on non-normative, theoretical sentences. Instead, only hypothetical imperatives (and their corresponding 'ought-sentences') fit Husserl's analysis, according to Kroner's view.
### Category: bohr-correspondence
Question: What principle does Bohr suggest explains why only certain spectral lines are observed in experiments?
Answer:Bohr suggests that the correspondence principle is what explains why only certain spectral lines are observed in experiments.
### Category: causal-models
Question: What is the role of endogenous variables in a system where they are each a function of their parents and an exogenous variable?
Answer:In such a system, endogenous variables \(X_i\) are influenced by both their parents in set \(\bV\) and an exogenous variable \(U_i\). This implies that endogenous variables' values are determined by internal factors within the system as well as external factors, represented by the exogenous variables.
### Category: incompatibilism-arguments
Question: How does the compatibilist view the relationship between the truth of determinism and the belief in free will?
Answer:The compatibilist believes that the truth of determinism is compatible with the truth of our belief that we have free will, denying that the truth of determinism would mean our belief in free will is false.
### Category: hamann
Question: How did Hamann view the interconnectedness of different aspects of human experience and knowledge?
Answer:Hamann believed that human experience and knowledge were inherently interconnected and disliked attempts to isolate phenomena from other aspects that he felt were intimately connected. He argued that a deep and true understanding of our existence could only be achieved by acknowledging these connections, even going so far as to suggest that philosophy of language must include a discussion of God, and that a discussion of God must make reference to sexuality and vice versa.
### Category: paine
Question: What is the purpose of Agrarian Justice, according to Thomas Paine?
Answer:According to Thomas Paine, the purpose of Agrarian Justice is to provide a principled defense for welfare provision, based on the idea of original equality of man and the equal right to subsistence from the earth. He argues that every proprietor owes the community a ground-rent for the land they hold, which should be used as a right of inheritance for all, paying compensation for the loss of natural inheritance at the age of twenty-one and an annual grant to the aged. These payments are considered a matter of right, not of charity. The money is to be raised from progressive taxation in inherited wealth and will contribute to its more equal distribution.
### Category: self-consciousness
Question: How can philosophers understand the relationship between self-consciousness and awareness of others, and what are the different distinctions that can be made regarding this relationship?
Answer:Philosophers can understand the relationship between self-consciousness and awareness of others in two ways: either self-consciousness requires awareness of others, or awareness of others requires self-consciousness. In either case, there is a distinction between those accounts that consider such awareness to be an empirical condition versus those that consider it to be a strictly necessary or sufficient condition. Additionally, philosophers may distinguish between two senses of "awareness of others": knowledge of other minds versus mere representation of others, whether veridical or not.
### Category: scientific-reproducibility
Question: What does the fourth part of this review focus on?
Answer:The fourth part of this review focuses on describing initiatives proposed by the open science reform movement to improve reproducibility in science, as well as reflecting on the values and norms embodied by those reforms.
### Category: ceteris-paribus
Question: What is the strategy of non-negligibility in economics according to Lange (2002, 411; Lange 2000, 170f)?
Answer:The strategy of non-negligibility in economics, according to Lange (2002, 411; Lange 2000, 170f), is a strategy where scientists do not provide a complete list of all interfering factors in economic laws but rather only refer to those interfering factors that arise sufficiently often and can cause sufficiently great deviations from the law's expected outcome. For instance, in the economic law "cp, if the supply of a commodity increases then the price decreases," Lange argues that it may happen that the increase in supply is so small that no decrease in price results, or that the price does not decrease although the supply increases significantly due to a rare event such as a gigantic comet hitting the planet Earth and destroying all life on its surface. However, comets are negligible for the purposes of economists because their occurrence does not arise sufficiently often to count as interfering factors that are to be explicitly listed in the cp-conditions.
### Category: abelard
Question: What is the relationship between a form-matter composite and its matter?
Answer:A form-matter composite and its matter are essentially the same, yet they are not identical. The matter is prior to the composite in terms of properties, while the composite is posterior to its matter. The matter is not characterized by posteriority, and the composite is not characterized by priority. Therefore, the matter and composite are different in property despite being essentially the same.
### Category: mill
Question: What is Mill's view on the relationship between pleasure and character in his ethical theory?
Answer:Mill sees pleasure as having a complex relationship with character in his ethical theory. He argues that different pleasurable experiences can have different values, and associates pleasures with the characters that give rise to them. This view allows Mill to maintain his hedonistic foundations while still emphasizing character in his practical theorizing. It also enables him to claim that virtues can become part of one's happiness.
### Category: computational-complexity
Question: Why might someone think that using nonstandard models with infinitely many predecessors is incompatible with strict finitism?
Answer:They might think so because strict finitism posits that only finite objects and concepts can be meaningfully considered in mathematics, and nonstandard models with infinitely many predecessors seem to involve infinite objects, which could be seen as going against the principles of strict finitism.

Answer:No, quantum computers are not capable of performing computations that classical deterministic computers cannot, they can only simulate classical computations in a more tedious way.
### Category: contractualism
Question: How does contractualism differ from utilitarianism regarding the treatment of individual rights?
Answer:Contractualism differs from utilitarianism by rejecting the interpersonal aggregation of burdens, recognizing that each of us has a unique life to live, and seeking principles that benefit each person individually and command each person's free assent. This approach emphasizes the separateness of persons, whereas utilitarianism tends to disregard it by allowing one person's rights to be sacrificed for greater aggregate benefits.
### Category: metaphysics

### Category: mohism
Question: Why might appealing to the Mohist conception of Heaven risk circularity in justifying their normative stance?
Answer:The Mohist conception of Heaven is that of a morally ideal sovereign with characteristics such as wisdom, impartiality, benevolence, and generosity. However, these are the same qualities that they believe an ethical theory should articulate. Therefore, using Heaven to justify their ethics could simply illustrate or articulate it without providing genuine justification, resulting in circularity.
### Category: moral-luck
Question: How does constitutive luck challenge the Control Principle in moral assessment?
Answer:Constitutive luck challenges the Control Principle in moral assessment by suggesting that both actions and agents are objects of moral assessment, and since both actions and agents can be significantly influenced by factors beyond their control, their moral assessment may not be entirely fair or accurate.
### Category: alienation
Question: What is the condition that makes certain separations, such as indifference or hostility, problematic in the context of alienation?
Answer:The condition that makes certain separations problematic in the context of alienation is that they violate a baseline harmony or connectedness between the relevant entities, which is considered rational, natural, or good. The disruption of this baseline harmony is not necessarily all-things-considered bad, as alienation could potentially be a justified or positive step in some cases.
### Category: medieval-philosophy
Question: Can someone with no university education make significant contributions to the field of philosophy during the medieval Latin world?
Answer:Yes, Dante is an example of someone who made significant contributions to philosophy during the medieval Latin world without a university education.

### Category: bell-theorem
Question: What are two alternative approaches to achieving a detection loophole-free experiment that were explored historically?
Answer:Two alternative approaches to achieving a detection loophole-free experiment that were explored historically involved K,B mesons and solid state systems.
### Category: contractarianism
Question: How can the social contract device be used in political philosophy?
Answer:The social contract device can be used in political philosophy in several ways, depending on how one answers three key questions. The first question is what the agreement is about, with possible answers including principles of justice, the design of basic social institutions, giving up of rights to a sovereign government, or adopting a disposition to be moral. The second question is how the agreement is to be thought of, with possible answers including hypothetical agreement, actual historical agreement, or implicit historical situation. The third question is whether the contract device is used as justification or explanation. Normative contractarianism uses it primarily as justification, while some philosophers such as Hobbes and Locke may have thought that there was an explanatory element to it, and some contemporary contractarians use it to explain the origin of oppression.
### Category: schopenhauer
Question: Who was G. E. Schulze's philosophical target in his work Aenesidemus?

### Category: innate-acquired
Question: Why are judgments about the relative magnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions considered non-local or context sensitive?
Answer:Judgments about the relative magnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions are non-local or context sensitive because they depend on the specific population and environment being studied, as well as the comparison classes chosen. Different comparison classes can lead to different conclusions about whether certain traits are more genetically or environmentally influenced.
### Category: states-of-affairs
Question: How does distinguishing between states of affairs based on their ontological dependence affect the identity criterion for states of affairs?
Answer:By distinguishing between states of affairs based on their ontological dependence, we can correctly consider Hesperus's being a planet and Phosphorus's being a planet as the same state of affairs, since they depend on the same object, whereas Hesperus's being self-identical and Socrates' being self-identical come out as different states of affairs, as they depend on different objects.
### Category: ecology
Question: What is the explanatory ideal of ecology that is rarely satisfied?
Answer:The explanatory ideal of ecology is having both a predictively accurate quantitative model and mechanisms incorporated in the model that have a clear and unambiguous biological interpretation.

### Category: ethics-social-networking
Question: What two potential issues with online social environments does Borgmann identify?
Answer:Borgmann identifies two potential issues with online social environments. Firstly, he argues that these environments can be ethically problematic because they compete with our organic and embodied social presence, often providing more convenience, pleasure, and ease than face-to-face interactions. Secondly, Borgmann claims that online social environments are inherently ethically deficient in themselves.
### Category: computational-complexity
Question: What can we infer about the relationship between P and NP when it comes to time complexity of deterministic Turing machines?

### Category: seneca
Question: What type of emotion is anger according to the Stoics, and what judgments are involved in feeling anger?
Answer:According to the Stoics, anger is a kind of desire that results in action. It is tied up with irrational action and involves several judgments, starting with 'He wronged me'. This initial judgment then leads to the desire for revenge, which is an impulse towards action if there is no external impediment
### Category: lying-definition
Question: What is an example of deception that does not require the deceiver to have a belief about the truth of the false belief they are causing in another person?
Answer:An example of deception that does not require the deceiver to have a belief about the truth of the false belief they are causing in another person is when Michael convinces Gertrude that the bridge is safe, but Michael has no belief whatsoever regarding the condition of the bridge. This is still considered deception because Michael is causing Gertrude to have a false belief.
### Category: logic-manyvalued
Question: What are two common designations for the particular truth degrees often assumed in many-valued logic?
Answer:The two particular truth degrees often assumed in many-valued logic are usually denoted by “0” and “1”, representing the traditional truth values “falsum” and “verum” respectively, or sometimes like “absolutely false” and “absolutely true”, particularly in cases where the traditional truth values of classical logic “split” into a series of truth degrees.
### Category: gasset
Question: What is the consequence of resolving the problem regarding the distinction between mental and physical phenomena, according to Ortega?
Answer:According to Ortega, resolving the problem concerning the distinction between mental and physical phenomena will consequently settle questions pertaining to the object and method of psychology and logic, the nature of inner perception and introspection, the possibility of a descriptive psychology of thinking, the meaning of intuition, and whether or not nonnutritive thought is possible.
### Category: justep-foundational
Question: What is the preliminary suggestion for restricting the class of necessary truths that we can be infallibly justified in believing?
Answer:The preliminary suggestion is that P entails* Q only if the fact that would make P true is at least a constituent of the fact that would make Q true. This would help to ensure that there is a close enough connection between the justification for the belief and the belief itself. However, this is just a starting point, and a more detailed account of facts and their constituents would be needed to fully address this issue.
### Category: monotheism
Question: What is the controversial premise in this argument and what is an alternative view presented by Thomas V. Morris?
Answer:The controversial premise in this argument is premise 1. According to Thomas V. Morris, for persons to be distinct, all that is needed is the possibility that their wills differ. For example, it is possible for person x to will A while person y neither wills A nor not-A (and vice versa), even if their wills cannot conflict.
### Category: scientific-reproducibility
Question: What is the "excess in statistical significance" and how is it related to bias in publishing statistically significant results?
Answer:The "excess in statistical significance" refers to the difference between the proportion of statistically significant results in a field and the average statistical power of studies in that field. This difference can be used as an indicator of the strength of bias towards publishing statistically significant results, as it is unlikely that the proportion of statistically significant results would exceed the average statistical power if there was no such bias.
### Category: laozi
Question: What does nonaction imply about the distinction between value systems in society?

### Category: multiple-realizability
Question: Why might contemporary neuroscientific experimental techniques not work if radical multiple realizability is prevalent?
Answer:If radical multiple realizability is widespread, neuroscientific experimental techniques that assume continuity of underlying neural mechanisms across different species might not bear scientific fruit. This is because it would be unjustified to make assumptions about continuity in the presence of radical multiple realizability. This could undermine the validity of many neuroscience experimental techniques and conclusions drawn from them, such as experimenting on macaque visual system to investigate human visual processing, or using PET and fMRI to reveal common areas of high metabolic activity during psychological task performance in humans.
### Category: reasons-just-vs-expl
Question: What is the characterization of a reason given by Donald Davidson in his 1963 paper, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes"?

Answer:Van Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and Pacuit (2009) have shown that dynamic-epistemic logics can be seen as decidable fragments of more expressive temporal logics, helping to clarify the connection between local dynamic logics of agency and global temporal logics.
### Category: apriori
Question: What are the three main views about the nature of a priori justification?
Answer:The three main views about the nature of a priori justification are that it is not significantly different from empirical justification, that it rests on a distinct type of internal mental state called rational intuition or rational insight which can provide evidence for or against certain propositions, and that a person can be a priori entitled to believe certain propositions independently of any evidence, or can be default reasonable in accepting a proposition independent of any evidence.
### Category: object

### Category: ethics-pregnancy
Question: What potential issue might arise if non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) becomes more routine due to its non-invasiveness, low medical risk, and high accuracy?
Answer:One potential issue that might arise if NIPT becomes more routine is the affirmation of anti-disability bias and devaluation of disabled lives, particularly regarding Down Syndrome. This is because NIPT can provide early information about certain genetic conditions, which may increase the likelihood of selective abortions and potentially contribute to a societal undervaluation of individuals with these conditions.
### Category: francis-bacon
Question: In what way does Nova Atlantis relate to Bacon's theory of induction and his speculative philosophy?

### Category: paternalism
Question: Why is manipulation often used as a criticism against nudges and what does it imply about how nudges are perceived in relation to our autonomy as rational choosers?
Answer:Manipulation is often used as a criticism against nudges because it is perceived as failing to respect our autonomy as rational and capable choosers. If we were capable choosers, the argument goes, we should be presented with reasons that favor acting in a particular way, rather than being nudged through other means.
### Category: induction-problem
Question: Why does Strawson argue that it is nonsensical to ask if an entire legal system is legal or not?
Answer:Strawson argues that it is nonsensical to ask if an entire legal system is legal or not because it would require appealing to some higher legal standards, but there are no such standards external to the legal system in question. Instead, we can only ask whether specific laws or actions within the system conform to its own internal standards
### Category: aristotle-biology
Question: Why is it difficult for us to know the specific details of how Aristotle carried out his biological investigations?
Answer:Aristotle did not provide any 'diaries' describing his day-to-day studies, and no one else reported observing him carrying out his studies. Additionally, his actual investigations were not systematically organized in his writings; rather, they were presented in a highly structured and theoretical manner, with few details about his methods of inquiry.
### Category: lvov-warsaw

### Category: rosenzweig
Question: What is the significance of human mortality in Rosenzweig's Star, and how does it contribute to his break-up of the "All" in philosophy?
Answer:Human mortality is significant in Rosenzweig's Star because it reveals the irreducible uniqueness of the individual and precipitates the break-up of the "All" in philosophy into three fundamental kinds of beings: God, world, and self. This break-up is influenced by the insights Rosenzweig draws from the human fear of death in the opening pages of the Star, which guide his quest for knowledge of the "true All" that has eluded the philosophical tradition's "old thinking."
### Category: recursive-functions

### Category: consequentializing
Question: What is one example of an act-consequentialist theory that accommodates both agent-favoring options and agent-sacrificing options?
Answer:Schefflerian utilitarianism is an example of an act-consequentialist theory that accommodates both agent-favoring options and agent-sacrificing options. It holds that an act is permissible if and only if there is no available alternative whose outcome outranks its outcome both in terms of utility for others and in terms of egoistically-adjusted utility, where egoistically-adjusted utility includes everyone’s utility but adjusts the overall total by giving the agent’s utility ten times the weight of each other’s.
### Category: kilvington
Question: What is Kilvington's view on what makes the temporal motion of a simple body in a vacuum possible?
Answer:Kilvington believes that the temporal motion of a simple body in a vacuum is possible due to internal resistance that arises when the peripheral parts of a body moving along oblique lines resist its central parts moving along straight lines. This internal resistance produces motion without impeding it, thereby guaranteeing temporal motion.

### Category: supererogation
Question: What is the common view on supererogation in ethical literature, and how does it attempt to reconcile supererogation with moral principles?
Answer:The common view in ethical literature is that supererogation is a legitimate class of moral action but only in a qualified sense due to certain conditions that limit its applicability or make the moral 'ought' not fully prescriptive. This view aims to reconcile supererogation with moral principles by distinguishing between different kinds of duties and obligations, thereby preserving the connection between value and duty without completely denying the existence and value of supererogatory action.

Answer:McTaggart believed that mysticism requires the recognition of a unity of the universe that is greater than that recognized by ordinary experience or by science. He thought that this unity does not necessarily imply numerical identity of the apparently distinct parts of the universe.
### Category: ethics-ancient
Question: What potential advantage might dogmatists have over those who merely conform to moral customs and norms when facing moral dilemmas?
Answer:When facing moral dilemmas, dogmatists with strong, rational convictions might have an advantage if they possess adequately justified beliefs to guide their decisions, unlike those who simply conform to moral customs and norms without reflection or justification.
### Category: supervenience-ethics
Question: What is the relationship between accepting Strong Intuitive ontological supervenience thesis and accepting an Ascriptive supervenience thesis with an alethic gloss on 'mistake'?
Answer:Anyone who accepts Strong Intuitive seems to be committed to accepting a version of Ascriptive, with an alethic gloss on 'mistake'.
### Category: perception-problem
Question: What is the consequence of accepting (B) in terms of the Common Kind Claim applied to veridical experiences and hallucinations?
Answer:Accepting (B) in terms of the Common Kind Claim applied to veridical experiences and hallucinations rules out an account of veridical experiences as direct presentations of ordinary objects. As a result, (C) follows, which states that we never directly perceive ordinary objects.
### Category: natural-law-ethics
Question: What is the Platonic view on the good and how does it differ from the Aristotelian view?
Answer:The Platonic view of the good holds that some things, such as knowledge and beauty, are good in themselves, regardless of human desire or perfection. This differs from the Aristotelian view, which understands the good in terms of human nature. In the Platonic view, human nature merely defines what is practically possible for humans to achieve, while the good remains separate from human desire. This view has not been widely defended, but it can be found in the works of philosophers such as Iris Murdoch and Michael Moore.
### Category: xunzi
Question: What is Mohism, a Chinese philosophical school founded during the Warring States period?
Answer:Mohism is a Chinese philosophical school founded during the Warring States period that emphasizes the importance of impartiality, utility, and the concept of "all-under-heaven." It was founded by Mozi and his followers, and they developed the Mohist canons, which are systematic and logical texts that discuss various aspects of Mohist thought.
### Category: disability-health
Question: What two features of many standard approaches to measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impact of disabilities?
Answer:The two features of many standard approaches to measuring HRQL that may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impact of disabilities are: 1) treating an individual's adaptation to a disability as a source of distortion or measurement artifact in assessing their well-being, and 2) expanding the definition of health outcomes to include not only the physiological and sensory-motor effects of disease and injury, but also their impact on daily living and social participation without distinguishing the contribution of medical and social/environmental factors to the restriction or loss of objectively valuable activities.
### Category: mill-moral-political
Question: What kind of conflict does Bentham's view seem to create by combining an ethical claim about aiming at general happiness with a psychological claim about aiming at one's own happiness?
Answer:Bentham's view seems to create a conflict between psychological egoism and morality's other-regarding or altruistic demands, as he combines an ethical claim that each of us ought to aim at the general happiness (pleasure) with the psychological claim that each of us can only aim (ultimately) at his own happiness (pleasure).
### Category: collective-responsibility
Question: What are some consequences that philosophers may consider when assessing collective responsibility in practice?
Answer:When assessing collective responsibility in practice, philosophers may consider both positive and negative consequences. Positive consequences include the reinforcement of norms associated with moral agency, while negative consequences may involve other unspecified ramifications.
### Category: statistics
Question: Is statistics considered by some to be non-inferential?
Answer:Yes, statistics is considered by some to be non-inferential, which contests its association with ampliative and inductive inference.
### Category: parenthood
Question: What potential issue do some people have with broad labor-based accounts of parenthood?
Answer:Some people may find it implausible that broad labor-based accounts of parenthood give the gestational mother veto power over other potential parents. This means that the gestational mother would have the final say in who becomes a parent, which some people may find problematic or unjust.
### Category: logic-justification
Question: What is the purpose of the unary operator '!' in the justification analog of \({\textsf{K4}}\), and what does it do to justifications?
Answer:The unary operator '!' is added to the term language in the justification analog of \({\textsf{K4}}\) to map justifications to justifications. If \(t\) is a justification for \(X\), then \(!t\) is a justification for \(t{:}X\). This operator is used to add conditions to a model in modal logic.
### Category: consequentializing
Question: Why does the consequentializer fail to align with commonsense intuitions regarding promise breaking even when taking into account the intrinsic badness of the act itself?
Answer:The consequentializer fails to align with commonsense intuitions regarding promise breaking even when taking into account the intrinsic badness of the act itself because it cannot accommodate the idea that an individual breaking a promise is wrong even if it produces equal or less overall good compared to not breaking it, as well as the notion that it is worse for multiple promise breakings to occur compared to just one.
### Category: skepticism-moral-responsibility
Question: What is one example of an argument for incompatibilism when it comes to free will?
Answer:One example of an argument for incompatibilism when it comes to free will is the argument based on determinism, which asserts that every event in the world is determined by prior causes, and therefore, there is no room for free will in a deterministic universe.
### Category: qm-bohm
Question: Why might one expect difficulties with the Lorentz invariance of Bohmian mechanics given its nonlocality?
Answer:One might expect difficulties with the Lorentz invariance of Bohmian mechanics due to its nonlocality because quantum theory itself is also nonlocal, and developing a Lorentz invariant formulation of quantum theory that avoids the vagueness of orthodox quantum theory is challenging. Additionally, the collapse rule of orthodox quantum theory violates Lorentz invariance. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect similar issues with Bohmian mechanics.
### Category: kochen-specker
Question: Who is credited with pointing out to Bell that Gleason's theorem implies a strengthening of von Neumann's result with the additivity requirement only for commuting observables?
Answer:J. M. Jauch is credited with pointing out to Bell that Gleason's theorem implies a strengthening of von Neumann's result with the additivity requirement only for commuting observables.
### Category: scientific-discovery
Question: What does Whewell's theory of discovery consist of in addition to the non-analyzable happy thought or eureka moment?
Answer:Whewell's theory of discovery also comprises the processes by which the happy thoughts are articulated, as well as the process of verification which is an integral part of discovery. The procedures of articulation and test are both analyzable according to Whewell, and his conception of colligation and verification serve as guidelines for how the discoverer should proceed.
### Category: grounds-moral-status
Question: What might be the consequence of extending the rights associated with Full Memory Share (FMS) to all animals according to Gilbert's view?
Answer:If the recipients of rights do not need to be members of the joint commitment that bestows such rights on them, then Gilbert's view could end up being overinclusive – the rights associated with FMS could be extended to all animals.
### Category: feminist-science
Question: What is the name of the dominant approach in sex differences in the brain research that Rebecca Jordan-Young criticizes in her book?
Answer:Brain organization research is the dominant approach in sex differences in the brain research that Rebecca Jordan-Young criticizes in her book.
### Category: bolzano
Question: What does it mean for a propositional form to be universally valid?
Answer:For a propositional form \(F\) to be universally valid, at least one member of \(F\) must be true, and every member of \(F\) with a non-empty subject idea must also be true.
### Category: meaning
Question: What is a suggested approach for understanding different types of classical semantic theories?
Answer:A suggested approach for understanding different types of classical semantic theories is to start with another type of theory, namely a theory of reference.
### Category: organs-sale
Question: What would be an example of coercion in the context of organ vendors?
Answer:In the context of organ vendors, an example of coercion would be if an organ vendor charges someone who would otherwise drown in a situation where there is a duty freely to rescue, such as when the organ vendor already has an independent duty to alleviate poverty.
### Category: kant-aesthetics
Question: What is the relationship between Kant's commitment to the objectivity of taste and the existence of erroneous judgments of taste?
Answer:The question of Kant's commitment to the objectivity of taste is closely related to whether there can be erroneous judgments of taste. If there can be erroneous judgments of taste, it suggests that taste is not purely subjective, which aligns with Kant's view of objective taste. Conversely, if there cannot be erroneous judgments of taste, it would be challenging to maintain that taste is objective in Kant's sense.
### Category: emotion
Question: What is Hufendiek's position on the distinction between basic and non-basic emotions?
Answer:Hufendiek (2016) argues that allegedly non-basic emotions manifest many of the same characteristics as basic emotions, challenging the value of this distinction.
### Category: emotion
Question: What is the role of the hardwired mechanisms in BDTE according to Reisenzein (2009a)?
Answer:The hardwired mechanisms in BDTE compare newly acquired beliefs with existing desires and existing beliefs, monitoring and updating the central representational system of humans (the belief-desire system). This process leads to adaptive responses such as refocusing of attention, updating of beliefs and experiencing emotions like pleasure and happiness.
### Category: location-mereology
Question: What is the objection from the topic-neutrality of parthood that questions the necessity of locational subregionhood for parthood?
Answer:The objection from the topic-neutrality of parthood argues that entities need not be located in space or spacetime to be parts or have parts. It gives the example of the word type 'cat' being a part of the sentence type 'the cat is on the mat', despite neither of them being located in space or spacetime. Therefore, locational subregionhood is unnecessary for parthood according to this objection.
### Category: weyl
Question: Why might Hermann Weyl have become disenchanted with intuitionism in mathematics?
Answer:Hermann Weyl may have become disenchanted with intuitionism in mathematics due to his growing belief that the strict adherence to intuitionistic doctrine would require mathematical sacrifices, such as giving up the least upper bound principle and other significant results of classical analysis, which would be unacceptable to practicing mathematicians.
### Category: statistics
Question: What happens to the influence of the prior probability over hypotheses as the sample size tends to infinity in Bayesian analysis?
Answer:As the sample size tends to infinity in Bayesian analysis, the prior probabilities over hypotheses tend to have less influence on the output, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as "washing out" of the priors.
### Category: frantz-fanon
Question: In what geographical region did Frantz Fanon focus most of his writings about Africa?
Answer:Frantz Fanon focused most of his writings about Africa in North Africa, particularly in Algeria.
### Category: fitzralph
Question: Why, according to FitzRalph, can future actions not be necessarily determined by God's revelation of their consequences?
Answer:For FitzRalph, if someone were to act necessarily, his or her actions would be neither just nor unjust. Therefore, God's revelation of future consequences cannot relate to a person's present state of grace but to actions freely undertaken in the future, as it is consistent with God being good and not acting arbitrarily or irrationally. Someone might freely sin even if the future consequences were revealed to him, but that does not mean that he is compelled to sin.
### Category: value-theory
Question: What is the term used to describe the view that moral statements do not have truth-value because they do not express propositions?
Answer:Non-cognitivism is the term used to describe the view that moral statements do not have truth-value because they do not express propositions.
### Category: ontological-commitment
Question: What is the difference between ontological commitments and ideological commitments of a theory?
Answer:Ontological commitments refer to what a theory says exists, whereas ideological commitments refer to the concepts, logical or non-logical, that are expressible within the theory. Ontological commitment and ideological commitment are largely independent of one another. Ontological commitment is the focus of discussion in this article, while recent metaphysics has given increasing importance to ideological commitment in providing a criterion of theory choice.
### Category: reid-memory-identity
Question: How does Reid understand memory in relation to past apprehension?
Answer:Reid views memory as an act of preservation through conception and belief of a past apprehension, without constituting an additional apprehension or current apprehension of past events. He believes that we cannot currently apprehend past events; instead, memory preserves past apprehensions by conceiving of an event previously apprehended and believing that it happened to us.
### Category: shantideva
Question: What is an area of similarity between Śāntideva's thought and virtue ethics?
Answer:Both Śāntideva and virtue ethicists place significant emphasis on the cultivation of character and becoming better people, rather than just focusing on consequences of actions alone. This similarity suggests that Śāntideva's thought might share important connections with virtue ethics theory.
### Category: abelard
Question: What theory of intentionality does Abelard propose instead of the conformality and resemblance theories?
Answer:Abelard proposes an adverbial theory of thought instead of the conformality and resemblance theories of intentionality.
### Category: feminism-gender
Question: What is Judith Butler's view on gender and how does she define it?
Answer:Judith Butler argues that gender is not an expression of one's biological sex but rather it is performative, meaning it is constituted through the repetition of stylized acts. Gender is not something one is but something one does; it is a sequence of acts, a doing rather than a being. She believes that repeated engagement in gender-coded acts congeals gender and makes people falsely think of gender as something they naturally are, when in fact it is something that is performed into existence.
### Category: williams-bernard
Question: What is the ultimate fate of utilitarianism, according to Bernard Williams?
Answer:Bernard Williams argues that the ultimate fate of utilitarianism is to usher itself from the scene, as it is not coherently combinable with the ambition to live one's life from the inside, and it would be best if no one actually acts as a utilitarian in their moral deliberations.
### Category: medieval-syllogism
Question: How does Avicenna's logic differ from Aristotle's in terms of syllogisms?
Answer:Avicenna's logic distinguishes between connective and repetitive syllogisms, which roughly corresponds to Aristotle's categorical and hypothetical syllogisms.
### Category: constructivism-metaethics
Question: What do constructivists claim to offer as an advantage over traditional metaethical theories?
Answer:Constructivists claim to offer a solution to the tensions among the apparent features of normative truths - their objectivity, our knowledge of them, and their practical significance for us - by starting with an account of practical reason, which they believe has been left out by standard metaethics. They view traditional metaethical theories as misguided in their approach to understanding ethical judgments and normative truths.
### Category: prop-attitude-reports
Question: What is an example of a statement that might be made during a phone call where one person is trying to assure the other of their safety?
Answer:An example of such a statement could be “I do not believe that you are in danger.”
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What is one function of the phrase "A related observation is" at the beginning of a sentence?
Answer:The phrase "A related observation is" at the beginning of a sentence indicates that what follows is related to what has been previously discussed, often as further evidence or support.
### Category: femapproach-analytic
Question: How does Jane Duran view naturalized epistemology's potential contribution to a more inclusive epistemology that values features appreciated by feminist standpoint epistemology?
Answer:Jane Duran believes that naturalized epistemology is capable of including features valued by feminist standpoint epistemology due to its descriptive character and concern with context and details of knowing. She sees it as a positive step towards a 'gynocentric', i.e., woman-centered, epistemology by shifting focus from an abstract knower to the concrete facets of the person who has beliefs and knowledge.
### Category: metaepistemology
Question: What is the view of Richard Jeffrey and Richard Pettigrew regarding beliefs and credences?
Answer:Richard Jeffrey affirms credences while denying that beliefs exist, and Richard Pettigrew also affirms credences but expresses sympathy towards denying the existence of beliefs.
### Category: justice-inequality-health
Question: What does the mortality rate ratio of 1.0 in the Whitehall data represent?
Answer:In the Whitehall data, a mortality rate ratio of 1.0 indicates that the proportion of deaths in the professional/executive group is equal to the proportion of deaths in the reference group.
### Category: logic-relevance
Question: What is dialetheism and how does it relate to negation in logic?
Answer:Dialetheism is the view that there can be true contradictions, which challenges the traditional principle of non-contradiction in classical logic. It asserts that some statements can be both true and false at the same time. This perspective has implications for the understanding of negation in logic, as it requires reconsideration of how negation operates in logical systems.
### Category: spinoza-attributes
Question: How can Spinoza's claim that there are infinite attributes of an infinite substance be understood in terms of early modern philosophy's use of the term "infinity"?
Answer:In early modern philosophy, "infinity" often refers to totality rather than numeric infinity. Therefore, Spinoza's claim could be interpreted as meaning that the infinite substance has all the attributes that there are to be had, which is consistent with there being only two known attributes or many unknown attributes as well.
### Category: brouwer
Question: Where can one find a comprehensive list of writings by L.E.J. Brouwer?
Answer:A full bibliography of Brouwer’s writings can be found in [unspecified source].
### Category: hume-religion
Question: What is another criticism Hume raises against the cosmological argument regarding an infinite series of causes and effects?
Answer:Hume argues that an infinite series of causes and effects is assumed to require some explanation or cause for its existence in the cosmological argument. This implies that Hume believes an infinite series can be self-explanatory and does not necessarily need an external cause, contrary to the cosmological argument's assumption.
### Category: femapproach-continental
Question: What negative consequences do Asian American women experience as a result of "yellow fever", a racial fetishization of Asian women?
Answer:Asian American women who experience "yellow fever" face negative social impacts, including depersonalization and otherization, which can be harmful and difficult to navigate. These fetishes are not just harmless personal preferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that can have harmful effects on the individuals and communities being fetishized.
### Category: qm-collapse
Question: What is the claim that any GRW-like model can be seen as a phenomenological model deriving from a standard quantum evolution on a larger Hilbert space called?
Answer:This claim is often referred to as the "enlarged Hilbert space viewpoint" or "unitary embedding."
### Category: consciousness-intentionality
Question: What is the status of the term 'content' when it comes to discussing what someone thinks or believes?
Answer:The term 'content' is considered contentious in philosophical discussions of what someone thinks or believes, as it can be unclear what assumptions lie behind its use by various philosophers and whether they have the same thing in mind. It becomes a highly debated theoretical term once questions regarding its identity across multiple cases and subjects are raised.
### Category: causation-regularity
Question: How does Spohn's ranking-theoretic approach handle scenarios of overdetermination?
Answer:Spohn's ranking-theoretic approach to causation addresses scenarios of overdetermination in a way that is similar to probabilistic accounts of this type of causal situation.

### Category: xenocrates
Question: What is Aristotle's criticism of the Academics' argument that attempts to demonstrate that The One is the good itself?
Answer:Aristotle criticizes the Academics' argument as being "tricky" or "bizarre" due to its first premise that numbers strive to unify their units together. He also finds the argument gappy and unconvincing in its conclusion that The One is the good itself based on the premises that numbers aim for unification and that all things aim for some one good.
### Category: pm-notation
Question: What is the convention regarding the scope of logical connectives when parentheses are not used in a logical formula?
Answer:The convention is that \(\equiv\) has wider scope than \(\lor\) and &amp;, and \(\lor\) and &amp; have wider scope than \(\osim\). Additionally, \(\equiv\) has wider scope than \(\supset\).
### Category: metaphysics
Question: How does David Lewis account for modality de re in his theory without attributing all properties essentially to ordinary objects?
Answer:David Lewis accounts for modality de re by positing that ordinary objects have 'counterparts' in other possible worlds that play the role they play in their respective worlds. So, for example, if all of Socrates' counterparts are human, then Socrates is essentially human. This treatment allows Lewis to maintain that ordinary objects have some properties essentially without attributing all properties essentially to them.
### Category: kant-social-political
Question: What principle does Kant believe should be used as the basis for determining specific judgments of punishment in retributivist theory?
Answer:Kant believes that the principle of "like for like" should be used as the basis for determining specific judgments of punishment in retributivist theory, even though he recognizes that it may not always be possible to apply it literally.
### Category: logic-higher-order
Question: What result does Fagin's Theorem 17 from 1975 state about the definability of graph connectivity in \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\)?
Answer:Fagin's Theorem 17 from 1975 states that graph connectivity is not definable in \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\), which implies that \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\ne\mon\Pi^1_1\).

Answer:According to a default theory, if we can nonvacuously close a stage under an applicable default, we should do so. Otherwise, we do nothing.
### Category: empiricism-ancient-medieval
Question: Why does Ockham deny the real distinction between the agent intellect and the potential intellect?
Answer:Ockham denies the real distinction between the agent intellect and the potential intellect because he believes that there is no distinctive task left for the agent intellect to perform, as the mind can directly identify similarities among particular individuals without needing to abstract the universal from the particular. This is due to Ockham's rejection of common essences or natures and his belief in the mind's immediate grasp of singular objects, along with his nominalism that acknowledges real similarities but not as matters of convention.
### Category: qt-uncertainty
Question: What does Bohr caution against in quantum theory regarding terminology?
Answer:Bohr cautions against speaking of disturbing a phenomenon by observation or creating physical attributes to objects by measuring processes in quantum theory, as such language can be confusing and is a departure from basic language conventions. He suggests that while such language can be practical for brevity, it can never be unambiguous.
### Category: contractualism
Question: Why might one find it challenging to reject a principle that calls for a small sacrifice to prevent a significantly bad outcome?
Answer:One might find it challenging to reject such a principle because if their sacrifice is considerably smaller than the severe negative outcome they could prevent, it would be difficult to justify not acting in such a situation. This principle appeals to our sense of proportionality and fairness, making it more likely to be accepted as a guiding moral guideline.
### Category: progress
Question: Who were some of the major figures in the natural sciences during the intellectual achievements of the 16th and 17th centuries, and what scientific law did Newton synthesize from their work?
Answer:Some of the major figures in the natural sciences during the intellectual achievements of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Newton synthesized their work into the law of universal gravitation, which states that two bodies attract each other in proportion to their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.

### Category: peirce-logic
Question: Why is it ungrammatical to write "\(\unary{f} \inclusion \binary{m}\)"?
Answer:It is ungrammatical to write "\(\unary{f} \inclusion \binary{m}\)" because \(\binary{m}\), being a binary predicate, cannot have an inclusion relation with a unary predicate \(\unary{f}\).
### Category: speech-acts
Question: How does Roberts (2004, 2012) enrich our understanding of the relations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics such as presupposition and implicature?
Answer:Roberts (2004, 2012) enriches our understanding of the relations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics such as presupposition and implicature by developing the Question Under Discussion (QUD) model of conversational dynamics. In this model, common ground contains a partially ordered set of Interrogatives in addition to a set of Propositions. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how speech acts, such as asking a question, can influence other aspects of conversation, such as presuppositions and implicatures.
### Category: logical-empiricism
Question: What is Carnap's stance on the unity of the laws of science? Does he claim it is possible, mandatory, or does he leave it as an empirical question?
Answer:Carnap does not claim that scientific laws are unified or that they are not. Instead, he leaves it as an empirical question, and does not say that such unity is possible or mandatory. He believes that finding inferential connections among sets of laws would be welcome, but philosophers should not make pronouncements about scientific laws' unity without having putative laws in hand. A certain modest deference to the empirical facts is a reasonable approach, according to Carnap.
### Category: logics-for-games
Question: What kind of limit behavior can iterated announcements in games lead to besides common knowledge of rationality?
Answer:Iterated announcements in games can also lead to self-refutation, where repeatedly communicating certain information can result in knowledge or a different outcome than common knowledge of rationality. This is illustrated by the Muddy Children puzzle and certain situations in game theory where (credible) announcements of future irrationality can benefit some player.
### Category: albalag

### Category: experimental-moral
Question: What have some philosophers previously assumed about the instability of life satisfaction surveys?
Answer:Some philosophers have previously assumed that life satisfaction surveys are unstable and prone to order effects. They have believed that the correlation between global life satisfaction and specific aspects of life (such as romantic life or weather) depends on the order in which the questions are asked.
### Category: contractualism
Question: What dilemma do officials face when deciding between a Cautionary Policy and a Covert Policy regarding hazardous waste management, according to Williams (2006) and Kumar (2015)?
Answer:According to Williams (2006) and Kumar (2015), officials face a dilemma where they must choose between a Cautionary Policy, which involves issuing public warnings and erecting barriers but may result in more lung damage cases, and a Covert Policy, which involves removing the waste in secret, preventing public knowledge of the risk but resulting in fewer lung damage cases.

### Category: cognitive-disability
Question: What does Silvers propose as an alternative to using the concept of moral status?
Answer:Silvers proposes an account of justice that avoids prior assumptions about capacity and seeks to include as many beings as possible within a scheme of social cooperation, as she finds that proponents of both psychologically and biologically based criteria neglect gradations in relevant characteristics and overlook the potential to display or develop those characteristics, resulting in unwarranted exclusion.
### Category: artificial-intelligence
Question: Did Turing write a program for playing chess before there were computers to run such programs on?
Answer:Yes, Turing did write a program for playing chess before there were computers to run such programs on. He did this by following the code himself, well before 1950.
### Category: ethics-social-networking
Question: How does Luciano Floridi's informational theory of personal identity challenge the distinction between online and offline identities?
Answer:According to Floridi's informational theory of personal identity, our personal identities are externally constituted by our informational relations to other selves, events, and objects, both online and offline. This challenges the distinction between online and offline identities by suggesting that there is no clear boundary between the two.
### Category: autonomy-moral
Question: What is the implication of combining the view of autonomy with the endorsement constraint in liberalism?

### Category: johann-herbart
Question: What is the result of moving the observing eye and the touching finger forwards and backwards according to Husserl?
Answer:When moving the observing eye and the touching finger forwards and backwards, an unfathomable manifold of visible and tangible representations is generated at any given time. These representations then produce a train of innumerable fading, graded fusions with all the others. Furthermore, innumerable series are generated and become interwoven as the constantly generated perceptual representations gradually sink and shade away, fusing less and less with those that trail after.
### Category: mental-disorder
Question: What is the alternative to connecting responsibility with blame in psychiatric ethics, according to Hanna Pickard?
Answer:According to Hanna Pickard, uncoupling responsibility from blame and connecting it with an empathic attitude is an alternative approach when dealing with the apparently willful behavior of those diagnosed with disorders affecting agency in psychiatric ethics.
### Category: boethius
Question: What texts of Boethius were most important for logicians in the Middle Ages before the Prior Analytics became widely available?
Answer:Before the Prior Analytics became generally available in the later twelfth century, students learned syllogistic from Boethius’s monographs on it. The theory of topical argument, acquired especially from On Topical Differentiae, provided a framework for twelfth-century philosophers in propounding and analyzing arguments. From the combination of studying topical argument and the theory of hypothetical syllogisms as Boethius presented it, some philosophers were led towards their rediscovery of propositional logic.
### Category: culture-cogsci
Question: How does E.B. Tylor define culture in his work Primitive Culture?

### Category: humanism-civic
Question: How do different interpretations explain the apparent contradiction between Machiavelli's two major works, Discorsi and Il Principe?
Answer:Different interpretations attempt to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory positions by suggesting that Discorsi represents Machiavelli's genuine views and Il Principe is a satire or an attempt to regain his position in Florentine government. Others propose that Il Principe reflects Machiavelli's true teachings and Discorsi's principles are extensions of his earlier tract. Some interpreters also assert that no reconciliation is possible between these two works.

### Category: anselm
Question: What does Anselm consider as the definition of freedom and what are the implications of his definition?
Answer:Anselm defines freedom as "the power to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake." The implications of this definition, as argued in On Truth, are that freedom is also the capacity for justice and the capacity for moral praiseworthiness. Furthermore, he argues that it is both necessary and sufficient for justice, and thus for praiseworthiness, that an agent wills what is right, knowing it to be right, because it is right. This entails that an agent must not be compelled or bribed to perform the act, indicating that freedom is the power to perform acts of this kind.
### Category: language-thought
Question: When did LOTH, or Language of Thought Hypothesis, first receive systematic treatment?
Answer:LOTH first received systematic treatment in William of Ockham's Summa Logicae, which was completed around 1323.
### Category: qt-consciousness
Question: Why are strictly monotonic transfer functions considered less suitable for stabilizing neuronal assemblies?
Answer:Strictly monotonic transfer functions are considered less suitable for stabilizing neuronal assemblies because increasing input results in increasing output without any regulation. This makes it difficult to achieve a balanced operation of the activated neuronal assembly.
### Category: free-will-foreknowledge
Question: What is the main criticism Hunt has against Fischer's "boot-strapping" account of divine foreknowledge?
Answer:The main criticism Hunt has against Fischer's "boot-strapping" account of divine foreknowledge is that it is circular and cannot support anything close to exhaustive foreknowledge. According to Hunt, most future contingent truths will lack Knowledge-Conferring Situations (KCS) at any given time, making it impossible for God to have infallible beliefs about them.
### Category: folkpsych-theory
Question: In what order do most American, Canadian, Australian, and German children typically develop their understanding of false belief (FB), deception (DD), knowledge acquisition (KA), desire (DB), and happiness/existence (HE) in relation to false belief?
Answer:Most American, Canadian, Australian, and German children typically develop their understanding of false belief (FB) after they have acquired an understanding of deception (DD), knowledge acquisition (KA), and desire (DB), in that order. However, happiness/existence (HE) in relation to false belief is usually the last to be understood.
### Category: future-contingents
Question: Why might it be reasonable to assume restrictions regarding the set of chronicles and its use in the semantical model in the Leibniz-theory?
Answer:It might be reasonable to assume restrictions regarding the set of chronicles and its use in the semantical model in the Leibniz-theory because there are potentially many maximal linear subsets in the branching time structure, and not all of them may be relevant or necessary for the purposes of the semantics. By considering modifications to the definition of \(C(t)\) used in the definition of chronicles, it may be possible to develop a more refined and appropriate semantical model for the Leibniz-theory.
### Category: walter-chatton

### Category: vienna-circle
Question: What was the main goal of the Vienna Circle in their approach to empiricism?
Answer:The main goal of the Vienna Circle was to reconceptualize empiricism by interpreting recent advances in the physical and formal sciences. They sought to account for the presuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting such theories within a logical framework, making the role of conventions evident and denying the existence of any synthetic a priori principles.
### Category: boundary
Question: What problem does Roderick Chisholm raise in relation to the concept of boundaries when an object is cut in half?
Answer:Chisholm raises the problem of how one boundary can become two boundaries when an object is cut in half, questioning whether this implies that two things can become identical with each other and become one thing.
### Category: transcendental-arguments
Question: What might Korsgaard's second argument be attempting in relation to the value of things and rational choice?
Answer:Korsgaard's second argument might be attempting to treat individuals as the source of value and make rational choice possible, while rejecting realism about value applying to things independently of us. This is done by using her notion of practical identity to potentially avoid problems identified in the Kantian argument.
### Category: scientific-reduction
Question: How can one provide an introduction to the concept of ground, according to Schaffer (2009)?

### Category: marx
Question: How might some interpret Marx's views on communism in relation to justice?
Answer:Some might interpret Marx's views on communism as a society where each person contributes according to their ability and receives according to their need, which could be adopted as a theory of justice. However, others might argue that it is more accurate to Marx's thought to say that communism transcends justice, as Lukes has argued.
### Category: recognition
Question: What kind of freedom can individuals only experience through relationships of mutual recognition in social endeavors?
Answer:Individuals can only experience a type of social freedom through relationships of mutual recognition in social endeavors. This freedom is an integral part of their (social) experience of valuing their own projects in living and acting in concert with others and feeling at home in their society's institutions.
### Category: logics-for-games
Question: What is one of the roles of probabilities in game theory?

### Category: formal-belief
Question: How does Harman interpret high degree beliefs in lotteries with many tickets?
Answer:Harman interprets high degree beliefs in lotteries with many tickets not as graded belief attitudes toward propositions, but rather as full beliefs about objective probabilities. So, in the case of a fair lottery with ten thousand tickets, he would argue that the agent does not believe to a high degree that the \(n^{th}\) ticket will not win, but rather fully believes that it is objectively improbable that it will win.
### Category: feminism-liberal
Question: How does Nussbaum's explanation of personal autonomy relate to procedural accounts of autonomy?
Answer:Nussbaum's explanation of personal autonomy is similar to procedural accounts of autonomy, as she echoes these accounts in her explanation. Procedural accounts of autonomy focus on the procedures or processes that lead to autonomous actions or decisions.
### Category: austin-jl
Question: What role does convention play in using language to describe the colors of objects, according to Strawson?
Answer:According to Strawson, convention plays an additional role in using language to describe the colors of objects beyond merely observing similarity. Specifically, he argues that saying "This is red" goes beyond merely saying "This is like those which were called red," as it involves a convention in choosing the name "red" for objects of that color. This is because we cannot literally see that objects have the same color; instead, we rely on conventions in naming colors that go beyond our natural perception of similarity.
### Category: biology-developmental
Question: What alternative perspective on genes and their role in development is suggested by the text?
Answer:The alternative perspective suggested by the text is that genes should be conceptualized as difference makers that operate conjunctly with other causal factors in development, rather than as the sole providers and organizers of material resources that determine phenotypic outcomes.
### Category: genrel-early
Question: What was Eddington's objective in his theory of the affine field, as mentioned at the beginning of his paper?
Answer:Eddington's objective in his theory of the affine field was to consolidate the known field laws and simplify the scheme, rather than seeking unknown laws as befits a unified field theory. He aimed to throw new light on the origin of the fundamental laws of physics by focusing on the consolidation of existing knowledge.
### Category: cloning
Question: How might the age difference between a clone and her progenitor potentially affect the clone's sense of identity?
Answer:The age difference between a clone and her progenitor could make it easier for the clone to view herself as distinct from the progenitor than if she had been genetically identical to someone her same age. This is because the age difference would likely contribute to the clone having distinct experiences and perspectives from her progenitor, further emphasizing their individuality.
### Category: cicero

### Category: physics-Rpcc
Question: What is the purpose of the Faithfulness Condition in causal inference?
Answer:The Faithfulness Condition is used in causal inference to infer a causal structure that entails any observed relation of conditional probabilistic independence, rather than one that doesn't. This principle is often supplemented to the Causal Markov Condition, which never entails probabilistic dependence.
### Category: xunzi
Question: What does Xunzi mean when he uses the term 'xing' in his argument with Mencius?
Answer:When Xunzi uses the term 'xing' in his argument with Mencius, he is referring to the basic faculties, capacities, and desires that we have from birth. Xunzi believes that following the impulses of our 'xing' without reflecting on them and moderating them will lead us to act harmfully.

### Category: mohist-canons
Question: What is the issue with combining 'oxen' and 'horses' in contrast to combining 'hard' and 'white' in early Chinese thought?
Answer:When 'oxen' and 'horses' are combined, the resulting phrase 'oxen-and-horses' denotes the sum of all oxen and horses. However, when 'hard' and 'white' are combined, it forms a phrase denoting things that are both hard and white in the same place at the same time. The reference does not directly reflect the structure of things in the world as in the one-name-one-thing model.
### Category: freewill
Question: What is the historical significance of the concept of free will in Western philosophy?
Answer:The concept of free will has been a significant topic of discussion in Western philosophy for over two millennia, with many important philosophical figures engaging in debates about its nature, existence, and significance. Disputes about free will inevitably involve disputes about metaphysics and ethics, as they raise questions about causation, laws of nature, time, substance, ontological reduction vs emergence, motivation, human persons, rightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and praise, reward and punishment, and desert.
### Category: arabic-islamic-phil-math
Question: How do Muslim philosophers distinguish between hypotheses and postulates in the foundational principles of the demonstrative sciences?
Answer:Muslim philosophers distinguish between hypotheses and postulates in the foundational principles of the demonstrative sciences based on the epistemic attitude of the student who is learning them. Hypotheses are the foundational principles that seem plausible to the student even though she has no proof for them. On the other hand, postulates seem dubious to the student, in the sense that she might have some feelings and ideas against the plausibility of these principles.
### Category: arendt
Question: How does thinking, as described by Arendt, affect the process of judgment?
Answer:According to Arendt, thinking loosens the grip of established criteria and values over the particular, releasing judgment from ossified categories of thought and conventional standards of assessment. This prepares the individual to judge for themselves instead of being swayed by the actions and opinions of the majority during times of historical crisis.
### Category: neo-kantianism
Question: What is the role of laws in achieving objectivity in the Marburg view?
Answer:In the Marburg view, laws play a crucial role in achieving objectivity by relating various appearances at different points of view in a law-like way, moving from appearance to reality. This notion of objectivity as lawfulness is then used to give an account of truth and objecthood in scientific theories and knowledge.

### Category: philosophy-religion
Question: Why might someone argue that the cosmos as a whole needs an explanation even if everything in it can be explained through infinite regress?
Answer:One might argue that the cosmos as a whole needs an explanation even if everything in it can be explained through infinite regress because infinite regresses do not actually satisfactorily explain, or because failing to seek an explanation for the whole is arbitrary. The question "Why is there a cosmos?" is considered a perfectly intelligible one if everything in the cosmos is contingent, and it seems just as reasonable to believe that the whole cosmos is contingent as it is to believe that if everything in the cosmos were invisible, the cosmos as a whole would be invisible.

### Category: reasoning-analogy
Question: What is the problem with restricting analogical reasoning to only conform to simple formal schema?
Answer:The problem is that such a restriction allows inferences that should not be considered valid. Embellishing formal schema with more rules has been attempted, but it seems that there is always some aspect of the analysis that must be handled intuitively without strict formal rules.
### Category: ryle
Question: How does Ryle suggest that philosophers, such as Aristotle, approach the study of concepts instead of contemplating abstract nouns?
Answer:Ryle suggests that philosophers study concepts by considering the concrete actions and situations that the associated words describe in context, rather than focusing on abstract nouns in isolation. For example, when studying the concept of pleasure, Aristotle analyzed specific instances where someone did or did not enjoy certain experiences or objects. Similarly, examining the concept of existence cannot be limited to merely reflecting on an abstract entity but must involve understanding its practical uses and implications in various contexts. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding concepts in relation to their real-world applications and consequences, rather than treating them as detached and independent entities.
### Category: common-knowledge
Question: What is often referred to in philosophical discussions using the term "Figure 3.5"?

### Category: kant-mathematics
Question: What is the difference between the analytic method and the synthetic method in Kant's philosophy?
Answer:The analytic method is a reasoning strategy that traces a given body of cognition, such as mathematics, to its origin or sources in the mind. The synthetic method, on the other hand, aims to derive real cognition directly from such original cognitive sources, which are first explicated independently of any particular body of cognition that the powers might ultimately produce. Kant adopts the former method in his Prolegomena and the latter method in the Critique of Pure Reason when discussing the possibility of pure mathematics.

### Category: lewis-ci
Question: What does Carnap mean when he says that objective judgments entail an indefinitely large set of hypothetical or conditional judgments?
Answer:Carnap is saying that any objective judgment, such as a perceptual judgment, analytically entails and is entailed by a wide range of conditional judgments about what is likely to be the case if certain conditions were met. For example, the judgment "There is a white piece of paper before me" implies a whole set of conditional judgments about what would be likely to be the case if one were to touch the paper, look at it from different angles, etc.
### Category: formal-epistemology
Question: What does the third axiom of probability theory explain about figuring out the probability of a hypothesis?
Answer:The third axiom of probability theory explains that the probability of a hypothesis can be figured by breaking it into parts and adding up their probabilities. For example, the probability that an American country will be the first to develop a cure for Alzheimer’s can be figured by adding the probability that a North American country will be first to the probability that a South American country will be.

### Category: civic-education
Question: Why does Gutmann argue that society cannot leave the education of future citizens to the will or whim of parents?
Answer:Gutmann argues that society cannot leave the education of future citizens to the will or whim of parents because democratic societies have the responsibility to educate all children for citizenship, and this education must cultivate a particular set of values that promote democratic ideals, which may not be guaranteed if left solely to parents' discretion. This perspective leads her to rule out certain exclusive suzerainties of power over educational theory and policy, including "the family state," in which all children are educated into the sole good life identified by the state.
### Category: privacy-medicine
Question: Why is respecting a person's interest in following their own convictions at the end of life crucial to preserving their general right to make intimate and personal choices?
Answer:Respecting a person's interest in following their own convictions at the end of life is crucial because it is such an integral part of their more general right to make intimate and personal choices that failing to protect this particular interest would undermine the overall right. This is due to the fact that death is one of the most significant events in each of our lives.
### Category: realism-theory-change
Question: What does Duhem believe is the relationship between the representative part and explanatory part of a scientific theory?
Answer:Duhem believes that the representative part of a scientific theory, which includes empirical laws and mathematical formalism, is more fundamental than the explanatory part. He sees the explanatory part, which involves physical models and explanatory hypotheses about unobservable causes of phenomena, as parasitic on the representative part. Duhem argues that when a theory is abandoned, its representative part is often retained in its successor theory, while its attempted explanations get abandoned.
### Category: abhidharma
Question: What is the process of sensory perception in the five-sense-door process?
Answer:The process of sensory perception in the five-sense-door process involves a greater number of functions than the mind-door process. These functions include: 1) disturbed inactive mind, 2) adverting, 3) perceiving, 4) receiving, 5) investigating, 6) impulsion, and 7) retaining. These functions allow for the mind to turn towards the object at the appropriate sense "door", perceive the sense object with minimal interpretation, establish the nature of the sense object, and determine the mind’s response to that object. Additionally, the sense faculty and its sense object condition the arising of a present moment of a corresponding apprehending consciousness in the five-sense-door process.
### Category: marriage
Question: What is one criticism against the contractual view regarding family morality that is based on voluntarism?
Answer:One criticism is that voluntarist conceptions of the family conflict with common-sense intuitions that there are unchosen special duties between family members, such as filial duties. However, voluntarism alone does not entail the contractual view, for it does not entail that spouses can negotiate the obligations of marriage or that they be subject to release.
### Category: money-finance

Question: What effect does evidence of hallucination or perceptual illusion have on a person's belief in a physical state of affairs, regardless of whether direct or indirect realism is true?
Answer:Evidence of hallucination or perceptual illusion undermines a person's belief in a physical state of affairs to the same extent in both direct and indirect realism.
### Category: psychologism
Question: How does Meiland illustrate his idea with an example involving gravity and planetary motion?
Answer:Meiland uses the example of gravity and the laws of planetary motion to help explain his idea. By observing the motion of planets, we can infer the existence of gravity as the best explanation for their movements. This demonstrates how abduction can be used to justify hypotheses in a way that is similar to how gravity can be inferred from observing planetary motion.
### Category: euthanasia-voluntary
Question: Why might the distinction between passive and active euthanasia be considered unclear and unhelpful?
Answer:The distinction between passive and active euthanasia might be considered unclear and unhelpful because whether behavior is described as an act or an omission (a key aspect of this distinction) is often determined by pragmatic considerations rather than deeper moral importance. For example, delaying response to a 'not for resuscitation' request or disconnecting a respirator can be seen as either acts or omissions, making it difficult to maintain a clear separation between passive and active euthanasia.
### Category: feminism-autonomy
Question: What are three examples of failures of autonomy that have been discussed in feminist literature in relation to gender oppression?
Answer:The three examples of failures of autonomy that have been widely discussed in feminist literature in relation to gender oppression are: (1) reproductive control, (2) sexual autonomy, and (3) self-definition.
### Category: vienna-circle
Question: What alternative did Reichenbach propose to the criterion of strict verifiability in defense of empiricism?
Answer:Reichenbach proposed replacing the criterion of strict verifiability with one demanding only that the degree of probability of meaningful statements be determinable in defense of empiricism.
### Category: measurement-science
Question: How did William Jevons measure changes in the value of gold in the nineteenth century?
Answer:William Jevons measured changes in the value of gold by postulating certain causal relationships between the value of gold, the supply of gold, and the general level of prices. He used two models to make these measurements: a causal-theoretical model of the economy, which was based on the assumption that the quantity of gold has the capacity to raise or lower prices; and a statistical model of the data, which was based on the assumption that local variations in prices are mutually independent and therefore cancel each other out when averaged. Taken together, these models allowed Jevons to infer the change in the value of gold from data concerning the historical prices of various goods.
### Category: voting-methods
Question: What is the assumption made about the voters' opinions when it comes to probabilistic independence in the context of determining correctness?
Answer:In the context of probabilistic independence, it is assumed that voters' opinions do not influence each other; instead, they are independent of one another when determining correctness. This means that the probability of two or more voters being correct is calculated as the product of their individual probabilities of correctness.
### Category: neuroscience
Question: What is a common response in philosophy to prevent one form of explanation from merging into another?
Answer:A common response in philosophy to prevent one form of explanation from merging into another is to split the explanandum. This is the strategy used by both Chirimuuta and Ross in response to Kaplan and Craver's challenge.
### Category: scholz

### Category: supervenience-ethics
Question: How can normative necessity be understood in relation to nomic modality and fundamental normative laws?
Answer:Normative necessity can be understood as facts that follow from fundamental normative laws or principles, similar to how nomically necessary facts follow from laws of nature. For example, if (5) stated one of those fundamental normative laws, then the normative impossibility of something being good just because it is painful could be seen as a consequence of that underlying normative law.
### Category: chinese-epistemology
Question: What is the main hypothesis that Gongsun Long puts forward in his argument about the relationship between names and actualities?
Answer:Gongsun Long's main hypothesis is that language is not only a consecrated structure which embraces the essence of all existence but that its crucial function remains that of denominating actualities. This is the underlying hypothesis of his argument in The Dispute on Names and Actualities (Ming shi lun).
### Category: william-auvergne
Question: What is William's view on the continued existence of the souls of plants and animals after the death of their bodies?
Answer:William holds that these souls cease to exist upon the death of the plant or animal since all their proper operations depend on the body and there would be no point for their continued existence after the destruction of the body.
### Category: idealism
Question: Can epistemological idealism necessarily lead to metaphysical idealism?
Answer:Yes, Royce argued that it does because the isomorphism between knowledge and the known must be necessary and can only be explained if the known is also mental in some sense. However, simply acknowledging that our knowledge is shaped by our own point of view does not necessarily entail that reality is essentially mental.
### Category: nishida-kitaro
Question: How can the statements about Japan's special place in the world be interpreted according to a charitable reading?
Answer:A charitable reading of Nishida’s statements on the special place of Japan interprets them as advocating that his country overcome its outdated vision of itself as a colonizing nation, and embrace a global conception of itself as a nation interacting with other nations in a world of mutually defining equals.

### Category: descartes
Question: Why did Descartes not claim to establish metaphysically that the essence of matter is extension in his Discourse with its attached essays?
Answer:In his Discourse with its attached essays, Descartes did not claim to establish metaphysically that the essence of matter is extension because he only presented this idea as a hypothesis whose fruitfulness could be tested and proven by way of its results in the attached essays on Dioptrics and Meteorology. He did not engage in deep skepticism or claim metaphysical certainty in these early writings.
### Category: fundamentality

### Category: feyerabend
Question: How did Feyerabend's fellow science students initially view Ehrenhaft's work during the 1949 Alpbach seminar?
Answer:Feyerabend's fellow science students initially looked forward to exposing Ehrenhaft as a fraud during the 1949 Alpbach seminar, as they were staunch empiricists who did not doubt that science had to be adapted to facts. However, they later realized the nature of scientific rationality after witnessing Ehrenhaft's battle with orthodox physicists who used strategies similar to those of Galileo's opponents to defend their position.
### Category: delmedigo

### Category: descartes
Question: What did Descartes believe about nonhuman animals in terms of their abilities and consciousness?
Answer:Descartes regarded nonhuman animals as machines, devoid of mind and consciousness, and hence lacking in sentience. He believed that they do not have feelings or sensations and that their behaviors can be explained by purely material and mechanistic processes, including the functions of their sense organs. Nonhuman animals approach beneficial things and avoid dangers not because of any consciousness or sensations, but due to these mechanistic processes.
### Category: collective-responsibility
Question: What aspect of free will do philosophers often focus on when trying to apply the concept to real-world scenarios of moral responsibility?

### Category: process-philosophy
Question: What is the unifying feature of contemporary process-philosophical research?
Answer:The unifying feature of contemporary process-philosophical research is its metaphilosophical aim to revise long-standing theoretical habits.
### Category: digital-art
Question: What aspects of digitally interactive artworks does their algorithm determine?
Answer:The aspects of digitally interactive artworks that their algorithm determines include certain properties of the work itself, as opposed to properties of specific instances of the work that may be brought about by user interaction. This is similar to how musical or dance performances have inherent properties in their scores or choreographies, while allowing room for variation in their instances through performance.
### Category: truthmakers
Question: What is the potential implication of Armstrong's non-standard conception of ontological commitment if it is considered controversial?
Answer:If Armstrong's non-standard conception of ontological commitment remains controversial, then the infinite series of totality facts he is committed to may also be viewed as controversial and dismissed as mere ontological frippery.
### Category: causation-medieval
Question: What is one condition for making reliable causal inferences and coming to know causal propositions on the basis of experience, according to Ockham and other fourteenth-century theologians?
Answer:One condition for making reliable causal inferences and coming to know causal propositions on the basis of experience, according to Ockham and other fourteenth-century theologians, is the existence of a theory of natural kinds, as seen in Ockham's writing (Ordinatio Prologue, qu. 2: Opera Theologica I, p. 87).
### Category: malebranche-ideas
Question: What does Descartes claim about the possibility of doubting one's existence and mathematical truths even in the presence of an evil genius who deceives us?
Answer:Descartes claims that even in the presence of an evil genius who deceives us, we could not doubt our existence and mathematical truths such as "twice two equals four," because we perceive these truths through simple perception without the use of memory.
### Category: moral-cognitivism
Question: Why might non-cognitivism in metaethical theorizing be challenging due to the desideratum of consistency with most normative theories?
Answer:The desideratum of consistency with most normative theories can make non-cognitivism challenging because of the variety of kinds of moral theory and differing but allegedly consistent judgments proposed by theorists. This variety can create a lot of work for non-cognitivists in order to ensure their theory is consistent with the wide range of normative theories actually defended by serious normative ethical proponents.
### Category: qm-modal
Question: In what type of quantum measurement model is BDMI directly applied according to the text?
Answer:The text mentions that BDMI is directly applied to the quantum measurement problem in an ideal measurement according to the standard von Neumann model, where a quantum measurement is an interaction between a system S and a measuring apparatus M, prepared in a ready-to-measure state |p0⟩, eigenvector of the pointer observable P of M, and the state of S is a superposition of the eigenstates |ai⟩ of an observable A of S.
### Category: spacetime-iframes

### Category: intuitionism
Question: What kind of axioms related to continuity are typically included in the axiomatizations of lawless sequences?
Answer:The Axiom of Open Data, which states that for any formula \(A(\alpha)\) that does not contain any other nonlawlike parameters besides \(\alpha\), is an example of an axiom related to continuity that is typically included in the axiomatizations of lawless sequences.
### Category: lying-definition
Question: What are two ways in which deception can occur through omission according to Chisholm and Feehan?
Answer:Deception can occur through omission by allowing a person to acquire a false belief or continue with a false belief, and by allowing a person to cease to have a true belief or continue without a true belief. For example, one may allow a person to read a news story and acquire a false belief, and one may allow a person to continue to have a false belief by not correcting them. Additionally, one may allow a person to forget a true memory by not stopping them from getting distracted, and one may allow a person to continue without knowledge of something by not informing them.
### Category: paradox-skolem
Question: What are two philosophical conclusions that Skolem drew from Skolem's Paradox in his original 1922 paper?
Answer:Skolem drew two philosophical conclusions from Skolem's Paradox in his original 1922 paper: that set theory cannot serve as a "foundation for mathematics," and that axiomatizing set theory leads to a "relativity of set theoretic notions."
### Category: self-deception
Question: What is the paradox that arises when one attempts to intentionally deceive themselves into holding a belief they know to be false?
Answer:The paradox is that if the self-deceiver is aware they are deploying a deceitful strategy, then they cannot be effectively deceived by it. But if they are aware of their intention to deceive, it is difficult to see how they could be taken in by it. On the other hand, if it is impossible to be taken in by a strategy one knows is deceitful, then self-deception as it has traditionally been understood seems to be impossible as well.
### Category: law-limits
Question: Why is offense considered a controversial ground in Mill's harm principle and what kind of literature has it inspired?
Answer:Offense is considered controversial in Mill's harm principle because it goes beyond his original position. Its addition as a ground has inspired extensive literature discussing its relation to moral distress and its impact on strengthening or weakening Mill's position (Feinberg 1985; Hart 1963 [1982: 46]; Waldron 1987 [1993]; Simester & von Hirsch 2011: 99–140; Edwards 2019).

### Category: plato-metaphysics
Question: What is the relation between a Form and its essence in Plato's philosophy?
Answer:In Plato's philosophy, a Form is related to its essence through the predication relation of Being, meaning that each Form Is its essence. This essence captures what it is to be that Form and serves as its real definition. The Form is seen as an auto kath auto being, existing independently from any of its material instances or any other entities, whether another Form or the soul.
### Category: logic-inductive
Question: How does the Ratio Form of Bayes’ Theorem appear when it is expanded to account for a collection of distinct experiments and their outcomes?
Answer:The Ratio Form of Bayes’ Theorem takes the form of P(H|E &amp; X) = P(E|H &amp; X) * P(H) / (P(E|H &amp; X) * P(H) + P(E|~H &amp; X) * P(~H)) when it is expanded to represent the evidence as consisting of a collection of n distinct experiments (or observations) and their respective outcomes.
### Category: methodological-individualism
Question: What was one of the main fallacies that methodological individualism was designed to prevent in social science?
Answer:One of the main fallacies that methodological individualism was designed to prevent in social science was the fallacy of ignoring the potential for collective action problems in groups and moving too easily from an identification of a group interest to the ascription of an individual interest.
### Category: anarchism
Question: What is a condition for successful anarchist campaigns of disobedience to disassemble the state apparatus?
Answer:Successful anarchist campaigns of disobedience would need to be organized and widespread to have a chance of disassembling the state apparatus.
### Category: rationality-instrumental
Question: What is the difficulty faced by the weaker view, which suggests that we have a reason to be instrumentally coherent as such?
Answer:The difficulty faced by the weaker view is that it cannot explain the "strictness" of the Violation Claim, which holds that whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates some requirement. This strictness would thus remain unexplained by the weaker view.
### Category: freewill
Question: What is one view about free will that is not universally agreed upon but was still widely accepted by many philosophers?
Answer:Compatibilism, the view that free will is compatible with determinism, was widely accepted by many philosophers as an adequate account of free will, though there were some exceptions such as Spinoza, Reid, Kant, and possibly Descartes (as argued by Ragland 2006).
### Category: medieval-syllogism

### Category: moral-realism
Question: What alternative explanation do some moral realists offer when it comes to moral disagreements that cannot be traced back to nonmoral matters of fact?
Answer:Some moral realists argue that moral disagreements can be traced back to the distorting effects of emotions, attitudes, and interests that are bound up with moral issues. They also suggest that some disagreements may be due to people talking past each other or having insufficiently subtle understandings of what others are claiming. In some cases, they may even argue that certain disagreements are not fundamentally moral in nature.
### Category: hartley
Question: What would be the result of strictly following Hume's advice on using only terms referring to clear impressions in scientific practice?
Answer:Strictly following Hume's advice on using only terms referring to clear impressions in scientific practice would likely bring the practice of a science to a halt, as it would limit the use of more abstract, algebraic terms.
### Category: strauss-leo
Question: Why does Strauss argue that philosophy cannot refute or confirm belief in revelation?
Answer:Strauss argues that because belief in revelation is not based on self-evident knowledge, it cannot be disproven or supported by philosophy. This is because philosophical inquiry relies on reason, evidence, and logical argumentation, while belief in revelation is often based on faith, tradition, and divine inspiration. Therefore, these two modes of understanding cannot be fully reconciled or adjudicated by each other's standards
### Category: luxemburg
Question: How does Luxemburg describe the relationship between the development of commercial relations and peace among nations?
Answer:Luxemburg describes how the development of commercial relations did not bring peace among nations as classical economists had expected. Instead, she notes that "the harmony of interests between commercial nations in the East were proclaimed to the sound of gunfire in the Opium Wars."
### Category: rawls
Question: What does Rawls's difference principle aim to achieve in terms of social unity?
Answer:Rawls's difference principle aims to create social unity by ensuring that citizens know their economy works for everyone's benefit, and those with greater natural potential are not exploiting those who were less fortunate. This positive ideal contrasts with Nozick's libertarian freedom ideal and meritocratic ideas about economic justice dominant in many democracies. In Rawls's view, "men agree to share one another's fate."

### Category: rorty
Question: What is the central critique of Richard Rorty's philosophy?
Answer:The central critique of Richard Rorty's philosophy is his provocative account of knowledge as representation, which he sees as the defining project of modern philosophy. He argues that knowledge is not a mental mirroring of a mind-external world, but instead offers a contrasting image of philosophy that integrates and applies the achievements of Dewey, Hegel, and Darwin in a pragmatist synthesis of historicism and naturalism.
### Category: epistemology-bayesian
Question: What is another name for the Principal Principle in Bayesian statistics?
Answer:In Bayesian statistics, the Principal Principle is more often called the Direct Inference Principle.
### Category: practical-reason
Question: What kind of philosophers, despite their differences in views about the nature and scope of practical reason, seem to agree on the idea that there are structural requirements on our attitudes?
Answer:Both Humeans, who believe that there is no scope for the rational criticism of individual ends, and Kantians, who think that the requirements of reason ultimately constrain us to choose in accordance with the moral law, seem to agree on the idea that there are structural requirements on our attitudes when it comes to practical and theoretical deliberation. They acknowledge a kind of rational pressure to bring our beliefs and intentions into compliance with the instrumental principle and other standards of consistency and coherence.
### Category: thick-ethical-concepts
Question: How do Pragmatic Views suggest that thick and thin terms differ in kind according to truth-conditions?
Answer:Pragmatic Views suggest that thick terms aren't evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, but are only used evaluatively, while thin terms are evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions. This difference in kind would support Non-Centralism. However, some arguments for Pragmatic Views might imply that thin terms are equally not evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions but only used evaluatively, which would mean there is no difference in kind between thick and thin concepts in this respect.
### Category: civic-education
Question: What is one proposed solution for addressing issues such as student discipline, maintenance of school grounds, and cliques within the school?
Answer:A proposed solution is to make the operations of the school part of the curriculum and allow students to participate in making decisions that directly affect some of the day-to-day operations of the school, as well as topics and issues inside the classrooms.
### Category: innateness-language
Question: How do phrase structure rules describe the internal syntactic structures of sentence types in generative grammar?

Answer:Supervaluationism rejects inference rules such as contraposition, conditional proof, and reductio ad absurdum that classical logic accepts.
### Category: basing-epistemic
Question: What could be one way to address pseudo-overdetermination in Swain's theory?
Answer:One possible way to address pseudo-overdetermination in Swain's theory is by specifying the types of changes in one's epistemic situation that are consistent with it, and then ruling out any additional unwarranted inferences as inconsistent with such changes.
### Category: supervenience-ethics
Question: What is one example of an ethical explanation of the supervenience relation given by philosophers?
Answer:One example of an ethical explanation of the supervenience relation given by philosophers is the idea that the dictum "treat like cases alike!" is an ethical requirement of ethical reasoning. This explanation suggests that ethical properties supervene on base properties because similar base properties must be treated similarly from an ethical standpoint.
### Category: mill-moral-political
Question: What qualities does Mill attribute to women that are related to being more practical and less theoretical?
Answer:Mill claims that women are more intuitive and practical, less principled and theoretical than men. This assessment is part of a larger list of potential natural differences he considers between men and women.

Question: What is one example of property relations that does not respond directly to scarcity?
Answer:Intellectual property is an example of property relations that does not respond directly to scarcity.
### Category: logic-epistemic
Question: How can we determine if one logic is stronger than another?
Answer:We can determine if one logic is stronger than another by examining their frame properties and derivations. For instance, if all theorems of one logic can be derived in another logic, then the latter is at least as strong as the former. Additionally, if there exist theorems in the stronger logic that cannot be derived in the weaker one, then the stronger logic is strictly stronger than the weaker one.

He left behind a complex philosophical legacy that includes discussions of subjectivity, self-consciousness, epistemology, moral theory, political philosophy, interpretation, philosophy of history, religion, existentialism, aesthetics, and philosophy of art. Despite his literary focus, this legacy includes significant argumentative presuppositions and systematic implications that can be analyzed independently from his poetic production.
### Category: arcesilaus
Question: Why is our knowledge of Arcesilaus' work limited and controversial?
Answer:Our knowledge of Arcesilaus' work is limited because he did not write any philosophical works himself, and his arguments were initially preserved by his students and in the work of his opponents. These accounts of his arguments were later overlaid by Carneadean elaborations and subsumed into the general Academic and anti-Academic traditions, making it difficult to determine the precise nature of his skepticism. Additionally, the later skeptical writers who wrote about Arcesilaus' work offered incompatible interpretations of his philosophical position, further contributing to the controversy surrounding his work.

### Category: empiricism-ancient-medieval
Question: Why were the principles discussed in the development of the mean speed theorem not immediately subjected to experimental testing?
Answer:The principles discussed in the development of the mean speed theorem were not immediately subjected to experimental testing because they were not yet operationalized, or expressed in forms that would allow for such testing. This operationalization was only achieved later through Galileo's inclined plane experiments.
### Category: modesty-humility
Question: Why might there be a difference in how we relate to ourselves compared to how we relate to others, even if our actions towards ourselves and others are morally similar?
Answer:The difference in how we relate to ourselves compared to how we relate to others might stem from the fact that our actions towards ourselves and others can feel different, even if they share similar moral implications. This suggests that there may be unique considerations when it comes to our self-relation that do not apply when we relate to others.

### Category: spacetime-iframes
Question: Why did philosophers of the time believe that the heliocentric picture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary motions?
Answer:Philosophers of the time believed that the heliocentric picture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary motions because it identified the sun as the cause of planetary revolutions through its rotation on its axis, in the same sense as the planets' revolutions. This allowed them to explain the physical causes and effects of celestial motions within the established theory of the causes of these motions, namely the revolutions of the heavenly spheres.

### Category: personal-relationship-goods
Question: Why might it be challenging to enforce a duty to provide personal relationship goods?
Answer:It may be challenging to enforce a duty to provide personal relationship goods because we lack a legitimate way of doing it without violating some rights, as enforcing such a duty could potentially limit freedom of association.
### Category: pufendorf-moral
Question: What is the role of oaths in Pufendorf's natural law theory?
Answer:In Pufendorf's natural law theory, oaths serve as a special means for assuring others of the reliability of our speech acts and the promises and pacts that rest thereon, particularly given human fallibility and the need for additional assurance. They arise from the nature of particular cases and may require further regulation, with their rules both antedating civil sovereignty and eventually coming to depend on it in certain ways.

### Category: ethics-manipulation
Question: Why might children frequently use manipulative tactics?
Answer:Children might frequently use manipulative tactics because they often lack any other (or any other equally effective) way to get what they want.
### Category: computational-mind
Question: How does Chalmers justify mental properties according to the structuralist view?
Answer:According to the structuralist view, mental properties are individuated by their roles in a pattern of causal organization, which is then abstracted away from physical states that realize those roles. This means that psychological properties supervene upon causal topology, and satisfying a suitable computational description is sufficient for instantiating appropriate mental properties. Therefore, computational description plays a central role within psychological explanation, providing a solid foundation for cognitive science, as psychological description is a species of computational description.
### Category: category-theory
Question: What was one significant contribution of Lawvere's Ph.D. thesis in the field of category theory?

### Category: aristotle
Question: What is the justification for the first premise in the argument for matter and form that is derived from Aristotle's Physics i 7 and 8?
Answer:The first premise is justified by the thought that since there is no generation ex nihilo, in every instance of change something persists while something else is gained or lost. In substantial generation or destruction, a substantial form is gained or lost; in mere accidental change, the form gained or lost is itself accidental. Since these two ways of changing exhaust the kinds of change there are, in every instance of change there are two factors present. These are matter and form.
### Category: contract-law
Question: How does contract law enforce promissory duties and what distinguishes it from tort law in terms of remedial aims?
Answer:Contract law enforces promissory duties indirectly by requiring the promisor to insure the promisee's value of performance through expectation damages. This distinguishes it from tort law, where the remedial aim is to restore a status quo ante disturbed by a wrong, rather than vindicating the expectation of performance as in contract law.

### Category: content-narrow
Question: What is a "natural kind" as it is used in this example?
Answer:"Natural kind" refers to a category of things in the world that have an essential nature that determines their identity and behavior. In this example, water is considered a natural kind because it has an essential nature (being H2O) that determines its identity and behavior. This means that anything that is not H2O cannot be considered water, even if it has the same observable properties as water.
### Category: naturalism-mathematics
Question: Why are ontological naturalist views considered problematic and unpopular in contemporary philosophy?
Answer:Ontological naturalist views are considered problematic and unpopular due to issues such as the lack of a clear definition of 'nature', potential conflicts with scientific discoveries, and difficulty in accounting for normative domains of discourse. Additionally, many philosophers reject the reductionist tendencies of ontological naturalism in favor of more pluralistic approaches to understanding reality.
### Category: content-teleological
Question: What is the concept that Neander claims sensory-perceptual systems have, according to which they are caused by certain things to do something else?
Answer:Neander claims that sensory-perceptual systems have response functions, where to ‘respond’ to something is to be caused by it to do something else. For example, a visual system might be caused by a red instantiation to change into a RED state, and it might have been selected (in part) for being disposed to do so. This means, according to Neander, that the system has the function to respond to red instances by changing into a RED state.
### Category: methodological-individualism
Question: What assumption does Elster make regarding the relationship between methodological individualism and rational choice theory?
Answer:Elster assumes that rational choice theory flows directly from methodological individualism.
### Category: spacetime-theories
Question: What is the relationship between absolute accelerations and relative motions in the interval-relational interpretation of STR?
Answer:Despite absolute accelerations being in 1-1 correlation with patterns of spacetime interval relations, they cannot be eliminated in favor of merely relative motions. No absolute acceleration can fail to have an effect on the material body or bodies accelerated in the interval-relational interpretation of STR. This is because absolute motions have a direct impact on cross-temporal interval relations of the body with itself, and it is incorrect to conclude that all motion is relative motion of a body with respect to other bodies.
### Category: logic-connexive
Question: Can you name a dialogical semantical treatment of connexive logic?
Answer:Yes, Rahman and Rückert 2001 provide a dialogical semantical treatment of connexive logic.
### Category: spinoza-epistemology-mind
Question: What is the relationship between God's essence and God's infinite intellect in Spinoza's philosophy?
Answer:In Spinoza's philosophy, God's essence as a thinking substance is ontologically and explanatorily prior to God's infinite intellect, which is not part of or identical with divine nature or essence. The divine intellect is on par with finite minds in that they are both merely modes.
### Category: kant-religion
Question: How does Kant discuss hope in relation to happiness in the Critique of Pure Reason?

Question: How do models (P2a), (P2b), and (P2c) differ in their ability to evoke an audience's attitudes or behaviors versus express the speaker's attitudes?
Answer:(P2a) models better than (P2b) and (P2c) the dispositions of moral sentences to evoke an audience’s attitudes or behaviors, while (P2b) and (P2c) model better than (P2a) the dispositions of moral sentences to express a speaker’s attitudes.
### Category: zermelo-set-theory
Question: What is Russell's paradox and why is it significant in set theory?
Answer:Russell's paradox is a famous paradox in set theory, discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901. It reveals a contradiction in naive set theory by showing that the idea of a "set of all sets that do not contain themselves" leads to a logical contradiction. This paradox highlighted the need for more careful axiomatization in set theory and led to the development of alternative axiomatic theories that avoid this paradox.
### Category: darwinism
Question: What does it mean when it is said that variation generation is a 'chance' process in evolutionary theory?

### Category: logic-epistemic
Question: What is special about the normal modal logic S5, and which other modal logics does it contain as a subset?
Answer:The normal modal logic S5 is special because it is the smallest normal modal logic that contains all modal instances of T (the axiom of reflexivity), B (the axiom of symmetry), and 4 (the axiom of transitivity). In other words, S5 includes all the properties of T, B, and 4, and it is the smallest logic that does so.

### Category: epistemology-social
Question: What is the position of testimonial anti-reductionism regarding testimony as a source of evidence or justifiedness?
Answer:Testimonial anti-reductionism holds that testimony is a basic source of evidence or justifiedness. According to this position, a hearer has default or prima facie warrant in believing what the speaker says, regardless of how little positive evidence they have about the reliability and sincerity of the speaker or speakers in general.
### Category: religion-politics
Question: What is one possible interpretation of a coercive law that is justified to an agent, as mentioned in the argument from respect?
Answer:A coercive law that is justified to an agent could be understood as a rule that is imposed on an individual, with the justification being that it serves the best interests or promotes respect for that individual. This interpretation emphasizes the idea that coercive laws can still be legitimate if they respect the fundamental rights and autonomy of the individuals they govern.
### Category: buddhism-chan

### Category: formal-epistemology
Question: What is the formula for calculating the posterior probability of a hypothesis given evidence when the hypothesis entails the evidence, according to Bayes' theorem?
Answer:When the hypothesis \(H\) entails the evidence \(E\), Bayes' theorem can be written as \(p(H|E) = p(H) \frac{1}{p(E)}\), where \(p(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, \(p(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and \(p(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.
### Category: computational-linguistics

### Category: murdoch
Question: What is missing in MacIntyre's critique of modern moral discourse, according to him?
Answer:In MacIntyre's view, what is absent in modern moral discourse is any conception of achieving the Good as a task for human beings in community, such that transformation of the self requires transformation of social relationships (MacIntyre 1993: 2).
### Category: reasons-just-vs-expl
Question: What kind of claims about reasons can lead to paradoxical statements when the agent is mistaken about relevant beliefs?
Answer:Claims about what someone's reason is can lead to paradoxical statements when the agent is mistaken about relevant beliefs. For example, if someone insists that a person's reason for attending a party is that James will be there, even after learning that James won't be at the party, it would sound paradoxical.
### Category: qm
Question: Why might not every vector in the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces be expressible in the form of the tensor product of vectors from each Hilbert space?
Answer:This is because not every vector in the tensor product space can be uniquely factored into a tensor product of vectors from each Hilbert space. In other words, there might be vectors in the tensor product space that cannot be written as the tensor product of vectors from each Hilbert space. This is a consequence of the construction of the tensor product space as the smallest vector space that contains all possible tensor products of vectors from the original Hilbert spaces.
### Category: collective-intentionality
Question: What is Tuomela's response to the charge of circularity in his analysis of we-intentions?
Answer:Tuomela's response to the charge of circularity in his analysis of we-intentions has three elements. First, he argues that the collectivity consists in the participants' having we-intentions, which depends on their satisfaction of the collectivity condition. Second, he claims that his analysis is not an instance of vicious circularity from the participant's pre-analytic perspective. Third, he explains that we-intentions and other elements of his account are not independent building blocks but only analytically isolatable parts of a complex whole.
### Category: relations-medieval
Question: What is the most significant difference between medieval philosophers and Aristotle in regards to their beliefs?
Answer:The doctrine of the Trinity is perhaps the most significant difference between medieval philosophers' beliefs and those of Aristotle, as it goes against Aristotle's teachings. The Trinity is the belief in one God in three persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit - which is not something that Aristotle would have endorsed in his philosophy.
### Category: social-ontology
Question: Is the debate about the nature of language primarily concerned with its metaphysics?

### Category: political-obligation
Question: When did the full development of social contract theory occur and who were its main contributors during that time?
Answer:The full development of social contract theory occurred in the seventeenth century, with Thomas Hobbes and John Locke being its main contributors during that time. Hobbes expressed his ideas in his book Leviathan (1651) and Locke in his Second Treatise of Government (1690).
### Category: tense-aspect
Question: What must be done in discourse understanding to draw conclusions from unmentioned events?
Answer:In discourse understanding, to draw conclusions from unmentioned events, one has to strengthen the assumptions of the theory by assuming that only explicitly stated events have occurred in the discourse. This minimalist discourse model links discourse understanding to closed world reasoning, which is non-monotonic in nature, meaning that adding further premises can make previous inferences invalid.
### Category: ethics-belief
Question: What is a general principle that connects prudential ends with beliefs and obligations?
Answer:The principle suggests that if an individual has a prudential end (E), and belief that 'p' is likely to help achieve that end, then there is a prima facie obligation to believe that 'p'. This obligation becomes particularly strong if 'E' can only be achieved through belief in 'p', and if one is (or should be) aware of this fact.
### Category: spinoza-psychological
Question: How does Spinoza's interpretation of 'good' and 'evil' in IIIp39s contribute to the plausibility of his ethical naturalism in Parts IV and V?
Answer:Spinoza's broadening of the application of the terms 'good' and 'evil' in IIIp39s to include things other than what people presently desire or are averse to allows for an analysis of good and evil in terms of something other than an individual person’s current desires. This is crucial for his ethical naturalism in Parts IV and V, where he urges people to desire and do things in a way different from what they desire and do already. By doing so, Spinoza provides a more plausible account of ethics based on naturalism that is not limited by an individual's current desires but rather takes into account broader classes of things that can bring joy and contribute to the right way of living.
### Category: dubois
Question: How did Nietzsche understand conceptual analysis, according to Clark (1994)?
Answer:Nietzsche understood conceptual analysis as a process of historical inquiry that separates the distinct meanings that have been joined together through episode after episode of reinterpreting one and the same set of phenomena. According to Clark (1994), Nietzsche believed that historically formed concepts, such as our notion of punishment, are like ropes held together by the intertwining of strands, rather than by a single strand running through the whole thing. To analyze such concepts is not to find necessary and sufficient conditions for their use but to disentangle the various strands that have become so tightly woven together by the process of historical development that they seem inseparable.
### Category: god-necessary-being
Question: How does van Inwagen suggest one should approach interpreting texts about God creating everything in order to avoid asserting impossible propositions?
Answer:Van Inwagen argues that one should read texts about God creating everything in a restricted manner, as it is difficult to discern the scope of the universal quantifier in the usage of writers from nearly 2000 years ago. This approach seems appropriate for theistic Platonists in order to avoid asserting impossible propositions.
### Category: legal-positivism
Question: What distinction is being made in this quote between two types of enquiries regarding the existence of law?
Answer:The quote is distinguishing between an enquiry into the existence of law and an enquiry into whether the law conforms to an assumed standard. The first enquiry is about whether law exists, while the second enquiry is about the merit or demerit of the law based on some assumed standard.
### Category: philosophy-chile
Question: Why did Andrés Bello object to Briseño's Curso de filosofía moderna regarding its treatment of logic?
Answer:Andrés Bello objected to Briseño's Curso de filosofía moderna regarding its treatment of logic because he believed it focused solely on deductive logic and neglected other important aspects of logic. Additionally, Bello disagreed with Briseño's overemphasis on religion in the work.
### Category: leibniz-evil
Question: How have some atheists and Socinians characterized the existence of God in relation to the world we live in?
Answer:Some atheists and Socinians have characterized the existence of God as an underachievement on His part, given the state of the world we live in. They argue that if God existed, the world would be better, and since it is not, there is no such being or God is not the sort of being that traditional theism supposes Him to be.
### Category: statistics
Question: What is the significance of De Finetti's representation theorem in the context of subjectivist prior over hypotheses?
Answer:De Finetti's representation theorem demonstrates that every prior distribution can be associated with its own set of predictions and behavioral consequences, thus showing how priors are linked to beliefs that can be interpreted in terms of betting behavior. This provides a subjectivist response to the challenge that a prior over hypotheses is difficult to interpret.
### Category: psychiatry
Question: What is the approach of Bentall and Spaulding et al. in terms of developing the descriptive apparatus of their theory of the domain?
Answer:Bentall and Spaulding et al. develop the descriptive apparatus of their theory of the domain empirically in a way that ultimately fits their theory. Bentall stresses the cognitive science of psychotic phenomena, while Spaulding et al. look for correlations between clinically significant problems and a wider variety of underlying phenomena, spanning many levels of analysis from the intra-cellular to the socio-cultural. Their examples include low levels of cortisol and learning deficits.
### Category: value-theory
Question: What is another term for non-instrumental value, according to some philosophers?
Answer:Some philosophers use the term "telic" or "final" to refer to non-instrumental value, instead of "intrinsic".
### Category: legal-reas-interpret
Question: How do some legal theorists understand the distinction between law and adjudication in their accounts?
Answer:Some legal theorists argue that law and adjudication are two distinct concepts with separate answers. They contend that the law and the process of adjudication are not the same thing, and in settling disputes, judges may have discretion to consider extra-legal factors, modify existing law, or fill in gaps where existing law is indeterminate. Therefore, legal reasoning can be understood as either reasoning to establish the content of the law as it presently exists or reasoning from that content to reach a decision in a case that comes before the court.

Question: What did Han believe to be the foundation of the operation of the human mind?
Answer:Han believed that the operation of the human mind is dependent on ki, both original ki and corrupted ki.
### Category: money-finance
Question: What is fiduciary duty and what obligations does it impose on fiduciaries?
Answer:Fiduciary duty is a legal doctrine that aims to protect clients by imposing obligations on fiduciaries (those entrusted with others’ money) to act in the sole interest of beneficiaries (those who own the money). The obligations of fiduciaries typically include acting in a way that maximizes investment returns for the beneficiaries. However, some argue that there are cases where beneficiaries' broader interests may take precedence over financial returns, such as when investing in fossil fuels poses serious risks to people's future.
### Category: altruism
Question: What is the thought experiment proposed by Robert Nozick regarding the value of experiences?
Answer:The thought experiment proposed by Robert Nozick is called the "experience machine." It involves a neuroscientist manipulating one's brain to have any desired experiences, which would be illusory but highly realistic. Nozick argues that people would not choose to plug into this machine because there is much more value to life than just experiences
### Category: scientific-reduction
Question: What is the difference between epistemic and ontological forms of reduction according to Sarkar (1992)?
Answer:According to Sarkar (1992), epistemic reduction is defined in terms of explanation, using epistemic concepts, while ontological reduction is defined in non-epistemic terms.

Question: What are the three options suggested by Arrhenius when faced with an impossibility theorem in population ethics?
Answer:The three options suggested by Arrhenius when faced with an impossibility theorem in population ethics are: (1) to abandon some of the conditions on which the theorem is based; (2) to become moral sceptics; or (3) to try to explain away the significance of the proofs.
### Category: collective-intentionality
Question: How does Tollefsen's interpretationist account establish that groups can be subjects of intentional states?
Answer:Tollefsen's interpretationist account establishes that groups can be subjects of intentional states by focusing on the rational unity certain groups, such as organizations, are capable of displaying. This involves providing an elaborate account of their internal structure, i.e., of what constitutes them as proper targets for ascriptions of intentionality.
### Category: latin-american-analytic

Answer:Austin divides the items his theory of truth applies to into historical episodes of stating (statiings) and the propositions or things stated therein (what is stated).
### Category: ethics-ai
Question: Why might humans find companionship or even love with a predictable android attractive?
Answer:Humans might find companionship or even love with a predictable android attractive because of their deep emotional attachments to objects, and because it could provide them with a valuable goal, especially if they struggle with actual human relationships and already prefer animals or inanimate objects. This kind of relationship might also increase overall utility, even if it lacks depth.
### Category: innateness-cognition
Question: What is the main point of Chomsky's methodological distinction between competence and performance in language?
Answer:Chomsky's main point is that in order to study language scientifically, we need to focus on linguistic competence, or the mental representations that underlie language use, rather than on linguistic performance, which is the actual behavior itself. He argues that performance is too complex and influenced by many idiosyncratic factors to be studied effectively, and instead proposes that we should focus on understanding the rules of grammar that generate all grammatically correct sentences.
### Category: coercion
Question: What happens to the coerciveness of law if enforcement agencies are no longer able to function?
Answer:If enforcement agencies (such as police, vigilantes, or robots) quit, are bought/killed/shut off, the coerciveness of the law will quickly evaporate. For example, if the army decides to side with protestors rather than the government, the law loses its force in a hurry, no matter how legitimate.
### Category: arabic-islamic-causation
Question: What does al-Ghazālī argue against the idea that stones fall because they will and seek the center?
Answer:Al-Ghazālī argues that seeking and willing cannot be attributed to stones because they require knowledge of what is willed and sought after, which is only conceivable in animals. Therefore, he rejects the idea that stones fall because of their own will and seeking of the center.
### Category: mereology-medieval
Question: What general principle about the relationship between whole and parts does this quote suggest?
Answer:The quote suggests that integral wholes can only be predicated of their parts when they are taken all at once, indicating a principle that the whole is more than just the sum of its parts and cannot be understood by considering its parts in isolation.
### Category: phylogenetic-inference
Question: What is one way in which the speciation process is different from the simplifying assumption of lineage splits in phylogenetics?
Answer:The speciation process is often not instantaneous and can have internal structure within lineages, while the simplifying assumption of lineage splits in phylogenetics treats it as a singular event that wholly separates a lineage into two distinct new branches.
### Category: philosophy-mexico

### Category: rawls
Question: How would you describe the informational state of the representatives of actual citizens while situated behind the veil of ignorance?
Answer:Behind the veil of ignorance, the representatives of real citizens have limited information, which is a key aspect of John Rawls' thought experiment in his theory of justice.
### Category: desire
Question: What special relationship is there between desires and pleasure or displeasure, according to some philosophers who argue that an action-based theory of desire fails to distinguish judgments of goodness from desire?
Answer:According to these philosophers, a person moved by a desire always enjoys what is desired or eagerly anticipates the desire's satisfaction, whereas a person moved only by a judgment of goodness does not share these feelings. Therefore, desires may necessarily give rise to certain feelings of pleasure or displeasure.
### Category: singular-terms-medieval
Question: What issue arises when one tries to infer from a universal statement to singular terms which may not be of the correct type?
Answer:When inferring from a universal statement to singular terms, an issue arises when one uses singular terms (e.g. proper names) that may not be of the correct type, leading to potential fallacious inferences (e.g. inferring that a donkey is running from the statement that every man is running).
### Category: voting-methods
Question: What is the standard scenario described in the Condorcet jury theorem?
Answer:The Condorcet jury theorem typically describes a scenario where n voters must decide between two alternatives, only one of which is correct. This scenario is often exemplified by a jury determining whether a defendant is guilty or not.
### Category: modality-medieval
Question: Who was Avicenna and what was unique about his theory on modal logic?
Answer:Avicenna was a philosopher who lived in the 11th century and made significant contributions to modal logic. His theory was unique because it was based on the assumptions that the subject terms and predicate terms of assertoric and modal propositions stand for all possible applications and the truth-conditions of assertoric propositions and corresponding possibility propositions are the same. This led to the result that syllogisms with assertoric premises coincide with uniform possibility syllogisms.
### Category: morality-biology
Question: What do proponents of epistemic 'evolutionary debunking arguments' argue about the impact of evolutionary considerations on moral skepticism and traditional moral realism?
Answer:Proponents of epistemic 'evolutionary debunking arguments' argue that evolutionary considerations support moral skepticism or at least undermine traditional moral realism by providing a defeater for our moral beliefs if correctness for moral beliefs is construed in a realist fashion as accurate representation of objective or independent moral truths.
### Category: carnap
Question: Why did Schopenhauer consider metaphysics to be a distraction from his philosophical program?
Answer:Schopenhauer considered metaphysics to be a distraction from his philosophical program because he saw it as a kind of failed art form masquerading as knowledge, and therefore both fake art and fake knowledge. He believed that unlike logical or mathematical proofs or scientific theories, metaphysical proposals are unable to command widespread agreement, and even the criteria by which they should be judged are often in dispute.
### Category: bodily-awareness
Question: Should tactile sensations be distinguished from other types of sensations, such as thermal sensations?
Answer:Yes, there is a debate in the literature about whether tactile sensations should be distinguished from other types of sensations, such as thermal sensations. Some researchers argue that this distinction should be made, while others do not.
### Category: logic-modal-origins
Question: What did Lewis modify in the 1918 system of strict implication in his 1920 work, titled "Strict Implication—An Emendation"?
Answer:In his 1920 work, titled "Strict Implication—An Emendation", Lewis modified the 1918 system of strict implication by replacing the stronger axiom \(((p\Rightarrow q)\Leftrightarrow(\neg \Diamond q\Rightarrow \neg \Diamond p))\) with the weaker axiom \(((p\Rightarrow q)\Rightarrow(\neg \Diamond q\Rightarrow \neg \Diamond p))\).
### Category: lacan
Question: What is the view of Lacan on the Oedipal personas in relation to biological sex?

Question: What is the role of discursive thought (dianoia) in Proclus' epistemology, according to Helmig (2012)?
Answer:Discursive thought (dianoia) in Proclus' epistemology, as described by Helmig (2012), is responsible for knowing the 'why' of things, i.e., their causes. This is in contrast to opinion (doxa), which only knows the 'that', i.e., it can recognize objects but not explain their causes.
### Category: lvov-warsaw
Question: What was the emphasis of the Warsaw School of Logic regarding the dependence of primitive terms or axioms in logical systems?
Answer:The Warsaw School of Logic regarded the dependence of primitive terms or axioms as an essential defect in logical systems. They strongly emphasized the importance of logical systems being based on independent sets of primitive terms and axioms.
### Category: cognitive-disability
Question: Can full moral status be dependent on external circumstances in some group-based accounts?

### Category: marcus-aurelius
Question: What is the communal goal that Marcus Aurelius believes humans should strive towards?
Answer:According to Marcus Aurelius, the communal goal (to koinônikon telos) that humans should strive towards is contributing to the welfare of all humans as their fellow-citizens, as if they were living in a cosmopolis or cosmic city where everyone is a citizen. This involves acting justly and communally, and not taking actions that harm the community or its members.
### Category: disability-justice
Question: What major work by John Rawls marked a turning point in modern philosophical discussions of justice?
Answer:John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, is often considered a major work that marked a turning point in modern philosophical discussions of justice.
### Category: disability-justice
Question: Why might achieving an "ability-neutral" environment be more challenging than creating a "gender-neutral" one?
Answer:Achieving an "ability-neutral" environment is more challenging because disability scholars and activists have not specified what it means, and it may be conceptually incoherent or prohibitively expensive. In contrast, a "gender-neutral" environment is more straightforward as it can be readily conceived and achieved at modest cost.
### Category: social-ontology
Question: What is eliminativism about firms?
Answer:Eliminativism about firms is the view that firms do not have an independent existence and can be eliminated from our theoretical frameworks in favor of analyzing individual behaviors and contracts.
### Category: scientific-pluralism
Question: Why is the multiplicity of certain kinds of complementary models considered unproblematic in terms of producing reliable knowledge?
Answer:The multiplicity of complementary models is considered unproblematic in terms of producing reliable knowledge because they all provide useful information about the same features of the target system, even if different mathematical idealizations are used in their construction. This is often the case in fields such as fluid mechanics when modeling complex phenomena like turbulence flows.
### Category: process-theism
Question: How does Process Theism expand on Anselm's and Aquinas' views on divine love?
Answer:Process Theism expands on Anselm's and Aquinas' views on divine love by maintaining that love requires not only willing the good of the other but also includes sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the beloved. This is expressed in Whitehead's depiction of God as 'the great companion—the fellow-sufferer who understands', while Hartshorne emphasizes that this view allows for the belief that there is a being who can rejoice in all our joys and sorrows with subtle and appropriate sensitivity.
### Category: quantum-bayesian
Question: What is the stance of QBists regarding the conceptual problems of quantum theory associated with measurement or non-locality?
Answer:QBists argue that quantum theory, from their perspective, faces no such problems.
### Category: eternity
Question: What is the term used to describe a group of statements, one of which is claimed to follow from the others?
Answer:An argument is a group of statements, one of which is claimed to follow from the others.
### Category: gadamer
Question: How does Gadamer view prejudices in his philosophical hermeneutics?
Answer:Gadamer views prejudices in a positive light, as what open us up to what is to be understood, rather than as closing us off. He attempts to retrieve the original meaning of prejudice as 'pre-judgment' from its negative connotations that developed during the Renaissance. Gadamer's notion of our prior hermeneutical situatedness is built upon Heidegger's concept of 'fore-structures' of understanding in Being and Time.
### Category: communitarianism
Question: What is the communitarian view on the potential conflict between an individual's interest in leading freely chosen lives and their interest in community?
Answer:Communitarians believe that in cases of conflict between an individual's interest in leading freely chosen lives and their interest in community, the latter does not automatically take a back seat to the former. Instead, they advocate for striking a balance between freedom and community, with a slight inclination towards sustaining and promoting communal attachments that are crucial to our well-being.
### Category: preferences
Question: What is the issue with the standard discounted utility model and how can it be addressed?
Answer:The standard discounted utility model does not adequately represent human behavior, as shown by a preference pattern that prefers one apple today to two apples tomorrow but prefers two apples in 51 days to one apple in 50 days. This preference pattern is incompatible with the exponentially discounted utility model but can be accounted for in a bifactorial model with a declining discount rate. Psychologists and behavioral economists have proposed replacing Samuelson's exponential discounting model with a hyperbolic discounting model, which discounts future consumption with a parameter inversely proportional to the delay of consumption, thus covering examples like the above.
### Category: hate-speech
Question: Who are some of the key figures in the literature that discusses how pornography silences women?
Answer:Many of the important initial moves in this literature were crafted by feminist legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin. They were some of the key figures who discussed how (degrading and misogynist) pornography silences women.
### Category: substance
Question: Does Locke's appeal to 'life' eliminate the possibility of species divisions being concept-dependent and arbitrary conventions?
Answer:No, Locke's appeal to 'life' as a principle of organization that persists through change in living objects does not eliminate the possibility of species divisions being concept-dependent and arbitrary conventions. Even though we can recognize life itself and there are real continuities underlying our division of things into species, it is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life of one kind ends and another starts.
### Category: macroevolution
Question: How can the passive vs. driven larger-scale trends in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory be understood philosophically?
Answer:The passive vs. driven larger-scale trends in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory can be understood philosophically as either a distinction between trends generated by different causal mechanisms or as a distinction between different sorts of statistical phenomena. This intersects with philosophical disagreements about whether neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory is best understood as a causal theory or a statistical theory.
### Category: ryle
Question: What important aspect of thinking is overlooked by both reductionist and duplicationist views of thought, according to Ryle?
Answer:According to Ryle, both reductionist and duplicationist views of thought overlook the intention-to-find-out-what-happens-when, which is an essential aspect of experimental thinking. This adverbial intention is what he refers to as 'experimentally'.
### Category: logical-truth
Question: What is an example of an expression that has extra sense attached to it that is not codifiable purely inferentially?
Answer:An example of an expression that has extra sense attached to it that is not codifiable purely inferentially is the expression 'all', as it is used in inductive reasoning (Sainsbury 1991, pp. 316–7).
### Category: biology-experiment
Question: Who were some of the key figures in the various early 20th century genetic schools, and which school's approach became widely accepted and incorporated into the Evolutionary Synthesis?
Answer:In England, the Biometric school of Karl Pearson and Raphael Weldon developed a quantitative approach, while William Bateson led a rival Mendelian movement. In the United States, Thomas Hunt Morgan and his associates constructed genetic maps of the fruit fly, though William Castle also defended a different approach and theory of the gene. In Continental Europe, Hugo de Vries in the Netherlands, Carl Correns in Germany, and Erich Tschermak in Austria also contributed to early genetic schools. The American school of Thomas Hunt Morgan became widely accepted and incorporated into the Evolutionary Synthesis of the 1930s and 40s with its approach to mapping genes and its (ever-changing) theory of the gene.
### Category: truth-axiomatic
Question: Who developed the system known as KF and when was it first published under the label Ref(PA)?
Answer:The system known as KF was developed by Solomon Feferman and it was first published under the label Ref(PA) in 1991. However, Feferman had already presented his work on KF in lectures in 1979 and 1983, and unpublished manuscripts prior to its publication in 1991.
### Category: philosophy-mathematics
Question: Can someone still argue that mathematics is the science of formal systems even after the incompleteness theorems were proven?
Answer:Yes, it is coherent to maintain that mathematics is the science of formal systems even after the incompleteness theorems were proven.
### Category: qt-uncertainty
Question: What must be questioned and answered in order to address the issue of knowing both the momentum and position of an atomic object?
Answer:In order to address the issue of knowing both the momentum and position of an atomic object, one must question the physical reality of these two attributes of the object and refer to the mutually exclusive conditions for an unambiguous use of space-time concepts and dynamical conservation laws for an answer.
### Category: logical-form
Question: Why did Montague argue that grammar is misleading for the purpose of studying real semantics?
Answer:Montague argued that grammar is misleading for the purpose of studying real semantics because he believed that the study of valid inference still suggests that grammar disguises the structure of propositional thought. He maintained that the syntax of natural language is not an accurate reflection of the underlying propositional structures that logic is concerned with, and therefore one should not assume a naive conception of grammar when thinking about the relation of logic to grammar.
### Category: phenomenology
Question: What is Searle's view on the relationship between consciousness, intentionality, and biology in mental states?
Answer:Searle argues that consciousness and intentionality are essential properties of mental states, which are biologically produced by our brains. He rejects both materialism and functionalism, stating that mind is a biological property of organisms like us, and our brains "secrete" consciousness.
### Category: collective-responsibility
Question: What is the proposed condition for collectives to possess free will, according to Kendy Hess?
Answer:According to Kendy Hess, collectives possess free will to the extent that they act from their own "actional springs" and from their own "reasons-responsive mechanisms".
### Category: computational-linguistics
Question: How does one solution to the variable binding problem propose to tie the properties of an entity to that entity?
Answer:One solution to the variable binding problem proposes tying the properties of an entity to that entity by assuming that unit activation consists of pulses emitted at a globally fixed frequency, and pulse trains that are in phase with one another correspond to the same entity. This way, the properties of an entity that are active at a given point in time can be properly tied to that entity and not to other activated entities.
### Category: information
Question: What is the role of information technology in our society?
Answer:Information technology plays a pivotal role in the way we organize our lives in society.
### Category: aristotle-noncontradiction
Question: What does Aristotle claim follows from our ability to make comparative judgments, even if we cannot make absolute judgments?
Answer:Aristotle claims that even if we cannot make absolute judgments, our ability to make comparative judgments presupposes some absolute standard, and therefore something truth-like is still being presupposed. This means that we will not be prevented from having anything definite in our thought.
### Category: ethics-search
Question: What is the principle mentioned in Google's Code of Conduct that the company holds itself to a higher standard because it delivers great products and services?

Answer:Jared Diamond, May, Terborgh, Wilson & Willis were some of the conservation biologists who supported the idea of single large reserves being better than several small ones in the SLOSS debate.
### Category: wodeham
Question: What is one consequence of denying the existence of a first, uncaused cause?
Answer:One consequence of denying the existence of a first, uncaused cause is that it would result in an infinite series of caused causes without a terminating point.
### Category: logical-form
Question: What is the source of potential error or risk of going wrong in an argument—is it in the reasoning or in the premises?
Answer:The potential error or risk of going wrong in an argument comes from the premises rather than the reasoning, as long as the reasoning follows correctly from the premises without making any additional assumptions that might be false.
### Category: cassirer
Question: What is Cassirer's critique of philosophical empiricism in his work Substance and Function?
Answer:In Substance and Function, Cassirer criticizes philosophical empiricism for its reliance on the abstractionist theory of concept formation, which holds that general concepts are formed through induction from sensory particulars. Cassirer argues that this theory is an artifact of traditional Aristotelian logic and is no longer tenable in light of developments in modern formal logic and the axiomatic conception of mathematics. He maintains that modern mathematics has a formal and ideal meaning that cannot be accommodated within philosophical empiricism. Instead, Cassirer proposes a more abstract version of the genetic conception of knowledge based on the idea of a series of abstract formal structures, or systems of order, that approximate a final limit structure in a regulative sense.
### Category: assertion
Question: What is the cognitive model of conversation proposed by Stalnaker where propositions are added to the common ground when asserted and accepted?
Answer:On Stalnaker's cognitive model of conversation, propositions are presupposed in a conversation if they are on record as belonging to the common ground between the speakers. When an assertion is made and accepted in the conversation, its content is added to the common ground, and the truth of the proposition in question will be presupposed in later stages. The set of propositions that are presupposed at a given stage has an effect on the interpretation of new utterances made at that stage. Stalnaker models this common ground as a set of worlds in which all common ground propositions are true, known as the context set.
### Category: neoliberalism
Question: What type of redistributive measure does Buchanan's contractarianism support according to his social contract?
Answer:Buchanan's contractarianism supports a "productive" state that provides tax-financed goods and social insurance as part of his redistributive measures.
### Category: science-theory-observation
Question: How does the process of producing fMRI data differ from simple observation methods like looking and photographing?
Answer:The process of producing fMRI data is much more convoluted than simple observation methods like looking and photographing. It involves applying magnetic pulses to the subject's brain, coordinating the precessions of protons in hemoglobin and other bodily stuffs to make them emit radio signals, using elaborate algorithms to estimate blood oxygen levels at the places of signal origination, making assumptions about spatial and temporal relations to estimate levels of electrical activity in small regions of the brain, and finally using all of these computations to assign colors to pixels in a computer generated image of the brain. Therefore, it is not accurate to refer to fMRI as a form of observation.
### Category: mental-representation
Question: Who are Kosslyn and Pylyshyn, and what is their disagreement about in regards to mental representations?
Answer:Kosslyn (1980) argues that mental representations have spatial properties and tasks are accomplished via their examination and manipulation, while Pylyshyn (1979, 1981a, 1981b, 2003) argues that the same empirical facts can be explained using only discursive, propositional representations and cognitive processes defined over them, which Pylyshyn takes to be sentences in a language of thought.
### Category: art-ontology-history
Question: What potential consequence of Margolis' hypothesis does he acknowledge regarding the continued existence of a work of art when attention is absent?
Answer:Margolis acknowledges that under his hypothesis, in the absence of the right sort of attention, a work of art ceases to exist, even if the physical system remains intact. He also suggests that the work can return to existence when imaginative attention is directed at the physical system again, effectively reviving the aesthetic design associated with it.
### Category: phil-multimodallogic
Question: What is one of the most intriguing multi-modal systems in logic?
Answer:Modal first-order logic, which combines quantifiers and modalities, is one of the most intriguing multi-modal systems in logic.
### Category: brentano-judgement
Question: What are judgments of higher-order or 'meta-judgments' according to Brentano?
Answer:According to Brentano, judgments of higher-order or 'meta-judgments' are a type of proposition that negations like "No S is P" express instead of double-judgments.
### Category: proclus
Question: What is the role of opinion in Proclus' hierarchy of the soul's faculties?

Answer:If \(a\) is assumed to equal \(1 - a\), then \(a\) would equal \(1/2\).
### Category: popper
Question: What does Popper argue about unconditional scientific prophecies in natural sciences?
Answer:Popper argues that unconditional scientific prophecies are not characteristic of the natural sciences and that the mechanism by which they occur is not understood by historicists. He distinguishes between conditional scientific predictions and unconditional scientific prophecies, stating that the former are typical of natural sciences, taking the form of hypothetical assertions stating that certain changes will come about if and only if particular events antecedently take place.
### Category: logic-informal
Question: What criterion can informal logics use instead of truth when judging premises in certain contexts?
Answer:Informal logics can use acceptability as a criterion instead of truth when judging premises in certain contexts. This is often done when it is difficult to judge premises as true or false.
### Category: process-philosophy
Question: What are the two principal camps that processists fall into, according to Rescher?
Answer:The two principal camps that processists fall into, according to Rescher, are the teleological (and often theological) wing that sees nature's processuality as a matter of teleological directedness towards a positive destination, and the naturalistic (and generally secularist) wing that sees nature's processuality as a matter of an inner dynamicity without any directness or at least without any directedness towards a specifiable destination.
### Category: propositions-structured
Question: What logical relationship does a statement have when it is true but implies something that is not true?
Answer:A statement is inconsistent when it is true but implies something that is not true.
### Category: social-ontology
Question: What philosophical view argues that racial categories are an illusion because biological essentialism is inseparable from our racial categories?
Answer:Eliminativists argue that racial categories are an illusion because biological essentialism is inseparable from our racial categories.
### Category: jury-theorems
Question: What is the effect of weakening the competence premise in the Conditional Jury Theorem?
Answer:When the competence premise is weakened in the Conditional Jury Theorem, it results in the possibility that majorities can be wrong in large bodies of voters, unless the Conditional Clause (CC) holds and voters are always competent.
### Category: schopenhauer
Question: What is Schopenhauer's view on how to achieve more tranquil states of mind?
Answer:Schopenhauer believes that one can achieve more tranquil states of mind by directing everyday consciousness towards more extraordinary, universal, and less-individuated states of mind. He holds that violence and conflict are proportional to the degree of individuation and objectification, and thus by reducing these factors, one can reduce pain and increase peace.
### Category: madeleine-scudery
Question: What kind of topics were discussed in Scudéry's dialogues?
Answer:Scudéry's dialogues discussed philosophical issues such as the nature of virtues, passions, free will, and arguments for God's existence; literary issues including comparative merit of French poets, proper method of letter-writing, and nature of artistic mimesis; as well as scientific questions, such as defending a vitalist theory of animal life and contesting the mechanistic theory of the animal-machine.
### Category: perception-contents
Question: What is one possible view on the relation between experiences and beliefs, according to which experiences serve as perceptual grounds of dispositions to form beliefs?
Answer:According to this view, experiences are constitutively linked to beliefs, although they may not necessarily have contents that are constitutively linked to the contents of the beliefs. This view also suggests that perceptual grounds require a certain etiology involving sensory organs or functional equivalents.
### Category: hilbert-program
Question: What does Detlefsen's defense of Hilbert's Program entail regarding the requirement of consistency between ideal mathematics and real mathematics?
Answer:Detlefsen argues that Hilbertian instrumentalism only requires real-soundness, which means that ideal mathematics must not prove anything that conflicts with real mathematics, rather than requiring that ideal mathematics prove only real statements that real mathematics also proves.
### Category: hartley
Question: What was the original conception of Hartley's Observations project?
Answer:The original conception of Hartley's Observations project was to demonstrate that language about "self-interest," the "common good," and the "will of God" were different ways of saying the same thing, making it as much moral and religious as it was scientific.
### Category: possible-worlds
Question: What is the consequence of AE3 under AW3' in regards to the contingency of entities?

### Category: margaret-cavendish
Question: What is Cavendish's view on the nature of God in relation to being a body or immaterial?
Answer:Cavendish believes that God is immaterial and is the only immaterial entity, in contrast to Hobbes' suggestion that even God is a body if God has any reality.
### Category: moral-epistemology
Question: Can it be rational to trust moral emotions rather than moral beliefs even if they diverge? Provide an example where this might be the case.
Answer:Yes, it can be rational to trust moral emotions rather than moral beliefs even if they diverge. For instance, consider a woman who feels strong moral resentment at having been passed over for promotion in favor of someone whose performance was inferior to hers. Although she currently doesn't believe she has been wronged, her persistent resentment could be rationally grounded if there exists no morally relevant difference between her situation and one in which the morally right response is not in doubt from anyone's perspective but is contrary to the decision made in her case. This possibility arises because her emotions have been attuned to respond to other cases where a promotion has been granted unfairly.
### Category: qt-quantcomp
Question: What is the relationship between the behavior of the energy gap and the potential "speed-up" of the quantum adiabatic algorithm?
Answer:If the energy gap decreases exponentially with the size of the input, then the evolution time of the algorithm will increase exponentially; if the gap decreases polynomially, the decision problem so encoded could be solved efficiently in polynomial time. Therefore, the behavior of the energy gap is crucial for whether or not the quantum adiabatic algorithm can yield the desired "speed-up".

### Category: mill
Question: How does Mill's endorsement of down-to-earth realism in the philosophy of science appear to conflict with his claim that all knowledge is phenomenal and relativized?
Answer:Mill's claim that scientific process involves finding the structure already present in nature seems to contradict his claim that all knowledge is phenomenal and relativized because phenomenal knowledge is dependent on individual experiences and perceptions, whereas realism implies an objective reality independent of human perception. This creates a tension between Mill's belief in scientific realism and his skepticism towards a priori knowledge.
### Category: fitch-paradox
Question: What position does Williamson (1982) suggest that an anti-realist should accept in response to Fitch's proof?
Answer:Williamson (1982) suggests that an anti-realist should accept intuitionistic logic as a response to Fitch's proof, as he argues that it is not a refutation of anti-realism but rather a reason for adopting intuitionistic logic due to its verificationist or constructivist reading of negation and existential quantification, which does not validate the elimination of double negation.
### Category: skepticism-moral
Question: What is the implication if we accept that nobody can ever rule out moral nihilism, but some believers can rule out all other members of the modest contrast class?
Answer:In this case, the latter (some believers can rule out all other members of the modest contrast class) follows, but not the former (nobody can ever rule out moral nihilism).

Answer:The primary issue is the status of claim 17 in the argument, as resolving its status will ultimately determine whether priority monism can account for the qualitative heterogeneity of the cosmos, with claim 18 logically following from it.
### Category: logical-construction
Question: Why might the concept of "incomplete symbol" not be as fitting as "construction" when applied to propositional functions and propositions?
Answer:The concept of "incomplete symbol" might not be as fitting as "construction" when applied to propositional functions and propositions because it would necessitate a significant expansion of the notion to categorize propositions and even propositional functions as instances of the same logical phenomenon as definite descriptions. This broadening might not be justifiable or appropriate, making "construction" a more suitable alternative.

Answer:An example of two terms where one is more specific than the other but does not stand in the relationship of a determinate to its determinable is “yellow” and “yellow or angry”. Here, “yellow” is more specific than “yellow or angry”, but it does not determine “yellow or angry” in the same way that “color” determines “yellow”.
### Category: scientific-reproducibility
Question: How does the scientific method uniquely distinguish itself from other approaches in its handling of evidence for a claim?
Answer:The scientific method distinguishes itself from other approaches by publicly disclosing the basis of evidence for a claim. This open sharing of methodology allows for the possibility of anyone reproducing the entire body of scientific knowledge in principle.
### Category: corruption
Question: Why is it not enough to just add more offenses to the list of corruption without justification?
Answer:Without justification based on some principle(s), merely adding offenses to the list of corruption does not provide a sufficient understanding of what constitutes corruption. This is because doing so would not provide insight into the underlying concept of corruption, which requires theoretical or quasi-theoretical account.
### Category: kant-moral
Question: Why does Kant claim that we will our own happiness as an end according to natural necessity?
Answer:Kant claims that we will our own happiness as an end according to natural necessity because it is necessary for distinguishing assertoric from problematic imperatives and arguing for the imperfect duty of helping others. Additionally, he appears to rely on this claim in each of his examples of moral evaluation, as maxims in pursuit of happiness are the typical object of such evaluations.

### Category: malebranche-ideas
Question: Why does Malebranche claim that we must have at least a general and confused apprehension of an object before we can direct our attention to it?
Answer:Malebranche claims that we must have at least a general and confused apprehension of an object before we can direct our attention to it because he believes that this principle is a datum of our experience and that it has its origins in Plato's argument in the Meno that all knowledge is recollection. According to this argument, it is impossible to inquire about that of which one is ignorant, and one must be at least dimly aware of all things one seeks to know. Thus, learning is more like remembering than discovering something entirely new.

### Category: max-stirner
Question: How does Stirner view the concept of human nature in relation to the work of the left-Hegelians?
Answer:Stirner views human nature as having no universal or prescriptive content, and therefore incapable of grounding any claim about how one ought to live. He sees the left-Hegelians as reproducing the Feuerbachian error of separating the individual from their human essence and setting it above the individual as something to be strived for, and his own intellectual project is described as an attempt to rehabilitate the prosaic and mortal self in contrast to their work.
### Category: location-mereology
Question: How can immanent realism be expressed in terms of exact location?

### Category: berkeley
Question: What argument does Berkeley use against materialists who claim that material objects are necessary to explain our ideas?
Answer:Berkeley argues that material objects are not necessary to explain our ideas, as the best explanation of our consistent experiences with objects is not that they are caused by material objects, but rather by the weaknesses of the opponents' theories themselves.
### Category: genotype-phenotype
Question: Why has population genetics not pursued Lewontin's program of focusing on selection coefficients for long segments of chromosomes?
Answer:There could be several reasons why population genetics has not pursued Lewontin's program of focusing on selection coefficients for long segments of chromosomes, such as technical limitations, lack of resources or interest, or the complexity of the task. The text does not provide specific information on why this program has not been pursued. It only mentions that it has scarcely been pursued. It is also worth noting that even if this program had been pursued, ecological genetic analysis of variation in natural populations would still be needed to reintegrate ecological context into population genetics.
### Category: kant-hume-causality
Question: What kind of reasoning cannot be used to establish the relation of cause and effect, according to Hume's argument in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding?
Answer:Reasoning concerning matters of fact and existence cannot be used to establish the relation of cause and effect, according to Hume's argument in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. This is because such reasoning is always founded on the relation of cause and effect, creating a circular argument that Hume is trying to avoid.
### Category: meaning-normativity
Question: What is the issue with detaching 'ought' in the debate about semantic obligations and how does it differ between the narrow and wide scope readings?
Answer:The issue with detaching 'ought' concerns whether the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way (by applying 'green' to green objects) or implies a more disjunctive obligation (of applying 'green' to green objects or not meaning green by 'green'). In the narrow scope reading, one can detach 'ought', which supports the intuition that the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way. However, in the wide scope reading, one cannot detach 'ought', which implies a more disjunctive obligation.
### Category: obligationes
Question: What is the status of irrelevant propositions in an obligational disputation, according to Burley?
Answer:According to Burley, irrelevant propositions in an obligational disputation are not to be answered based on their logical status but instead, specific rules are given on how to handle them.
### Category: moral-arguments-god

### Category: causation-law
Question: What is an example of a legal rule that was not based on making truly causal discriminations but rather on legal policy?
Answer:The "first house rule" in tort law is an example of a legal rule that was not based on making truly causal discriminations but rather on legal policy. According to this rule, a railroad whose negligently emitted sparks burned an entire town was only liable for the house or houses directly ignited by its sparks, not for other houses ignited by the burning of those first burnt houses (Ryan v. New York Central RR). The rule was said to be justified by the policy of subsidizing the then developing railroad industry by protecting it from a liability that was thought to be potentially ruinous in its extent.
### Category: fechner
Question: Why does Fechner argue that the earth has a soul even if it lacks organic functions like a nervous system?
Answer:Fechner argues that the absence of organic functions in the earth does not disprove the existence of a soul; it only disproves the presence of an animal or human soul. He claims that it is easier to prove that the earth has a soul than plants do because we have souls and are part of the earth.
### Category: feminist-social-epistemology
Question: Why is gender a significant area of investigation for social epistemologists?
Answer:Gender is a significant area of investigation for social epistemologists because it is a category of social relations that has shaped our knowledge practices and is implicated in systems of oppression, particularly against women. Feminist epistemologists have sought to understand how social relations of gender affect knowledge production and whether they should play a role in good knowing.

Answer:The ideal of equality of opportunity is controversial because it can be interpreted in different ways, some of which may be opposed to one another. It is also disputed which of these ideals, if any, are morally acceptable and which should be enforced as requirements of justice. Moreover, debates about equality of opportunity reveal deep disagreements about the nature of fair terms of cooperation in modern societies.
### Category: feminist-sex-markets
Question: How does Elizabeth Anderson view the difference between prostitution and other low-status jobs?
Answer:Elizabeth Anderson argues that the good of sex is that it is a form of labor that is unique to prostitution and cannot be reciprocated, making it fundamentally different from other low-status jobs.
### Category: logic-inductive
Question: What does the Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem state about the likelihood ratios of two empirically distinct hypotheses as evidence accumulates?
Answer:The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem states that under certain conditions, if \(h_i\) is true and \(h_j\) is an alternative empirically distinct hypothesis, then it is very likely that as evidence accumulates (i.e., as n increases), a long enough sequence of experiments and observations will produce a sequence of outcomes that yields likelihood ratios approaching 0, favoring \(h_i\) over \(h_j\). Additionally, this theorem places an explicit lower bound on the “rate of probable convergence” of these likelihood ratios towards 0.
### Category: philo-larissa
Question: What principle of rationality did Philo's new conception imply, moving away from the position of mitigated skeptics?
Answer:Philo's new conception implied that rationality is compatible with outright error because it is rational to give straightforward, unqualified assent to impressions that might nonetheless be false, thus departing from the mitigated skeptics' view that identifies rationality with forming defeasible beliefs on the basis of available evidence while insulating rationality from practical error through qualified assent.
### Category: heredity
Question: What have been the traditional methods for estimating heritability and what were their limitations?
Answer:The traditional methods for estimating heritability include twin and family studies that use coarse-grained assumptions about genetic relatedness. These methods have been limited by their inability to consider biological details of genetic transmission, such as specific genes or DNA sequences. The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA allowed geneticists to begin refining heritability estimation with more attention to biological details.

### Category: mead
Question: What has been a recent trend in Mead scholarship regarding his published work?
Answer:A recent trend in Mead scholarship has been to reframe Mead's legacy by focusing on his published written canon, which consists of over 120 items, in order to present Mead in a voice closer to his own. This has led to innovative investigations into Mead's theories of experience, perception, action, emergence, society, mind, and social cognition. Future research with this approach has the potential to shed light on Mead's contributions to the philosophies of history, education, politics, and the social sciences.

### Category: supererogation
Question: What is supererogation and what role does it play in moral theory?
Answer:Supererogation is a category of actions that are praiseworthy yet not obligatory. It lies at the intersection of the axiological (the 'good') and the deontic (the 'ought'). Despite the fact that many moral theories appeal to both deontic and axiological concepts, supererogation has received scant and cursory discussion in those theories.
### Category: law-limits
Question: What is the main issue at stake between legal moralists and proponents of public reason regarding the justification of legal coercion?
Answer:The main issue at stake is whether legal justification should be steered towards the citizens subject to coercion themselves, leading to a module of political practical reasoning that is independent of comprehensive ethical or religious commitments, as proposed by proponents of public reason; or whether the moral truth, with due sensitivity to countervailing factors, should be the point of law as argued by legal moralists such as Moore. Legal moralists argue that there are no limits to hold back the moral truth, while proponents of public reason emphasize avoiding the zeal to embody the whole truth due to its potential to induce a feeling of vertigo.
### Category: teleological-arguments
Question: What is Hume's criticism of design arguments regarding the analogy between nature and human artifacts?
Answer:Hume criticized the analogy between nature and human artifacts in design arguments by pointing out that nature and its components are not very similar to human artifacts and exhibit significant differences from them, such as being alive versus not alive, and self-sustaining versus not self-sustaining. He suggested that the cosmos is more similar to a living organism than a machine. Hume argued that if the resemblance is distant in relevant respects, then the inference will be logically weak.
### Category: kant-spacetime
Question: What is the role of the conclusions in Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic, and how are they meant to be derived?
Answer:The conclusions in Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic are intended to follow from the arguments within the Metaphysical Exposition and the Transcendental Exposition. They are not given any additional argumentative support, and are meant to be entailed by the view that the representation of space is an a priori intuition. The first two conclusions labeled "a" and "b" are particularly robust, with the first one being quite startling.
### Category: language-india
Question: Why did the Sanskrit grammarians, Kātyāyana and Patañjali, consider the usage of vernacular languages to be religiously inferior compared to Sanskrit?
Answer:Kātyāyana and Patañjali believed that vernacular languages were degenerate or "fallen" forms of the divine language, Sanskrit. They attributed this degeneration to the inability of low-class speakers to speak proper Sanskrit. This belief was rooted in their view that Sanskrit, when used with an understanding of its grammar, leads to prosperity in this world and religious merit in the next, whereas vernacular languages do not have this religious value. The grammarians lumped together all improper linguistic usages, including incorrect Sanskrit and vernacular languages, under derogatory terms such as apaśabda and apabhraṃśa.
### Category: frantz-fanon
Question: How does Fanon's concept of the inferiority complex relate to the experience of Black people living under colonial rule?

Answer:The algebraic fibring method developed by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro (1999) improved the versatility of logical techniques by introducing (universal) categorial constructions, which made it possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal logics.
### Category: austin-jl
Question: How does Austin explain why people make perceptual judgments based on illusions?
Answer:Austin explains that perceptual judgments based on illusions can be explained by the way things look, rather than by any specific feature of what is experienced. He also notes that the explanation for each individual's judgment depends on their types of judgmental capacities, and not everyone would be inclined to make the same judgment. Those whose judgmental capacities are well trained might withhold judgment about the shape of the object based on other factors they perceive in the environment.
### Category: truthlikeness
Question: What is an example of how moving from a tautology to a false proposition would not help in getting closer to the truth?

### Category: feminism-political
Question: Why is feminist political philosophy considered by some to be the paradigmatic branch of feminist philosophy?
Answer:Feminist political philosophy is considered by some to be the paradigmatic branch of feminist philosophy because it best exemplifies the point of feminist theory, which is to understand and change the world. This branch of philosophy focuses directly on understanding and improving collective life, as well as examining the emergence and use/misuse of power in public life. Additionally, it encompasses work conducted by feminist theorists from various disciplines beyond philosophy.
### Category: reference
Question: What was Russell's proposed solution to the problem of identifying a single object as the referent of definite descriptions?
Answer:Russell proposed that descriptions do not refer, and instead posited a translation procedure for sentences of the form 'The A is B', which he suggested means: there is one and only one A, and that A is also B.
### Category: natural-theology
Question: Who is one philosopher that has put forward an argument about the world being conditioned by the values of fundamental constants?
Answer:William Lane Craig has developed an argument that proceeds by asserting that the world is conditioned principally by the values of fundamental constants.
### Category: logics-for-games
Question: What is Strong Rationality related to in terms of game solution methods?
Answer:Strong Rationality is related to the rationalizability program for game solution, where actions are discarded if a better response exists under all circumstances. It also drives a game solution method.

Question: What is Nozick not accusing patterned theories of doing with regards to exchanges between individuals under patterned distributions?
Answer:Nozick is not accusing patterned theories of forbidding the exchange between individuals under patterned distributions, but rather of something else entirely.
### Category: einstein-philscience
Question: What are the two central theses in Duhem's philosophy of science?
Answer:The two central theses in Duhem's philosophy of science are theoretical holism and the underdetermination of theory choice by empirical evidence. Theoretical holism refers to the idea that hypotheses are not tested in isolation but as part of whole bodies of theory. The underdetermination of theory choice by empirical evidence means that when there is a conflict between theory and evidence, the fit can be restored in multiple ways and no statement is immune to revision.
### Category: enhancement
Question: What potential dilemma arises when trying to establish criteria for moral upgrades in the context of human enhancement?
Answer:Establishing criteria for moral upgrades in the context of human enhancement can open a dilemma regarding whose account of virtues and sainthood should be followed, as it invites exploration of various philosophical traditions without providing a quick resolution for policy.
### Category: aristotle-rhetoric
Question: What does Aristotle's use of the term 'technical' imply about the means of persuasion in his Rhetoric?
Answer:The term 'technical' in Aristotle's Rhetoric implies that persuasion must be based on a method or art (technê), have a complete analysis of what is possibly persuasive, be provided by the speakers themselves through their speech, and address the actual subject matter at issue. Additionally, technical persuasion relies on reasoned understanding of why certain things are persuasive, rather than relying on random use of persuasive factors.
### Category: jury-theorems

### Category: theoretical-terms-science
Question: What can we do if the axioms of a theory are inconsistent or not empirically adequate, resulting in an empty set of admissible structures?
Answer:Even if the axioms of a theory fail to be fully consistent with empirical data and result in an empty set of admissible structures, we can still have some understanding of the theoretical terms. For instance, we have some understanding of the theoretical terms in classical mechanics, despite its limited applicability. Additionally, we may have inconsistent yet non-trivial scientific theories, as in the case of classical electrodynamics.
### Category: skepticism-medieval
Question: What significant consequence of the Condemnation of 1277, emphasizing God's omnipotence, spread throughout Christian epistemological discussions during the Middle Ages?
Answer:The consequence was an increased concern about God's potential deception, whether in specific instances or possibly even on a global scale. This introduced a new level of skeptical doubt into medieval discussions, despite the original strong aversion to skepticism and arguments against it found in Henry's work. For further exploration of these ideas, Perler (2010) provides a fascinating examination of various responses from the 13th and 14th centuries.
### Category: medieval-syllogism
Question: What is indicated regarding the simplicity of the syllogistic for composite modal sentences in William of Ockham's Summa logicae III-1?
Answer:The syllogistic for composite modal sentences is described as being straightforward and reduced to a few valid consequences, specifically six of them, according to William of Ockham's Summa logicae III-1.
### Category: ecological-genetics
Question: Why was neutral genetic polymorphism considered rare by the founders of ecological genetics?
Answer:Neutral genetic polymorphism was considered rare by the founders of ecological genetics because recurrent mutation was considered unlikely and was explicitly excluded from the definition of genetic polymorphism by Ford. Additionally, they believed that appreciable frequency of a neutral allele would take a long time.
### Category: quantum-field-theory
Question: What is the purpose of using Effective Field Theories (EFTs) in elementary particle physics?
Answer:The purpose of using EFTs in elementary particle physics is to describe relevant phenomena only in a certain domain of energy, as they contain only those terms that describe particles which are relevant for the respective range of energy. EFTs are inherently approximative and change with the range of energy considered. They are only applicable on a certain energy scale, and influences from higher energy processes contribute to average values but cannot be described in detail.
### Category: spinoza-political
Question: What is the naturalistic equivalent of a right of revolution proposed by Spinoza?
Answer:Spinoza proposes that if a sovereign is to maintain its right, it must legislate wisely, so as not to incite insurrection. This means that the right of the state is essentially constituted, and limited, by the power of the people, thus providing a naturalistic equivalent of a right of revolution.
### Category: qing-philosophy
Question: What was Huang's reason for studying the classics and history, according to the given quote?
Answer:Huang studied the classics and history in order to verify the changes and transformations of principle, as mentioned in the given quote. He believed that the study of classics is for the ordering of the world.
### Category: voting-methods
Question: What is the primary concern regarding the mathematical analysis of social phenomena in voting methods?
Answer:The primary concern is whether voting paradoxes are just theoretical constructs of the mathematical framework used to model elections or if they reflect real-life phenomena in elections. This concern raises many subtle issues about mathematical modeling in social sciences.
### Category: modularity-mind
Question: What negative claim does Fodor make regarding central systems in his hypothesis?
Answer:Fodor claims that central systems are not modular.
### Category: perfect-goodness
Question: What does 'perfect goodness' refer to when it is used to denote a specific perfection that an absolutely perfect being might have?
Answer:When 'perfect goodness' is used in this way, it refers to a particular way in which a thing can be great, and denotes the upper limit of greatness of that sort. It is often included in lists of the perfections exhibited by an absolutely perfect being, along with other perfections such as omniscience and omnipotence.
### Category: testimony-episprob
Question: What activity does considering contrasting cases inspire reflection about a particular question?
Answer:Thinking and contemplation about the difference between various cases can inspire reflection about a particular question or issue.
### Category: pineal-gland
Question: Why did Galen argue against the idea that the pineal gland regulates the flow of psychic pneuma in the brain?
Answer:Galen argued against this idea because the pineal gland is attached to the outside of the brain and cannot move on its own, making it unsuitable for such a role. Instead, he proposed that the "worm-like appendage" of the cerebellum is better qualified for this task.
### Category: leibniz-ethics
Question: What type of pleasure comes from the fulfillment of distinct rational inclinations as opposed to confused bodily inclinations?
Answer:The pleasure derived from fulfilling distinct rational inclinations comes from distinct knowledge, which is a distinct perception of harmony. This type of pleasure is different from the pleasure derived from fulfilling confused bodily inclinations since there is no end to the pleasure that can be gained from acquiring distinct knowledge due to the maximally harmonious nature of the universe. On the other hand, fulfilling confused bodily inclinations may lead to pain and suffering further on.
### Category: wittgenstein-mathematics
Question: Why does Wittgenstein argue that the diagonal proof does not prove that one infinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set?
Answer:Wittgenstein argues that infinite sets are not extensions, and hence not infinite extensions. Therefore, it is not possible to prove that one infinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set. He believes that the idea that there are numbers bigger than the infinite is a result of a logical sleight-of-hand, and that the giddiness and pleasant feeling of paradox that this idea creates may have been the chief reason set theory was invented.
### Category: frege
Question: What is the concept introduced by Frege in his work of 1893/1903, which is associated with each function and acts as a record of the value of the function for each argument?
Answer:The concept introduced by Frege in his work of 1893/1903, which is associated with each function and acts as a record of the value of the function for each argument, is called the course-of-values of the function.
### Category: disability
Question: What is Gregory's view on whether every limitation explained by atypicality or abnormality is a disability properly-so-called?
Answer:Gregory insists that these are, really, disabilities, but just not normally worth calling attention to as “disabilities”, since the aptness of this ascription in conversational context depends on the significance of the abilities at issue.
### Category: bell-theorem
Question: How does Bell explain that non-locality is not assumed but derived in quantum mechanics?
Answer:Bell explains that non-locality is derived in quantum mechanics through an EPR-type argument from a locality assumption and the perfect anticorrelations predicted by the considered quantum state (Bell 1981, fn  10).
### Category: states-of-affairs
Question: Who was one of the first philosophers to propose that progress can be made in addressing questions about value by considering the referents of ‘that’-clauses?
Answer:William David Ross, a British philosopher, was one of the first proponents of this approach to understanding value.
### Category: logic-fuzzy
Question: What type of game does Christian Fermüller and George Metcalfe's work correspond to optimal strategies in, and how has it been extended by Fermüller &amp; Roschger in 2014?
Answer:The game that Christian Fermüller and George Metcalfe's work corresponds to optimal strategies in is Giles’s game, and it has been extended by Fermüller &amp; Roschger in 2014 to characterize various types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, which model natural language expressions like “about half” or “almost all” in fuzzy logic.
### Category: desgabets
Question: Did Desgabets completely abandon Cartesian philosophy in his work, or were there elements he remained loyal to?
Answer:Desgabets did not completely abandon Cartesian philosophy; he remained loyal to Cartesian metaphysics (substance dualism, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and interaction, extension as matter's essence and thought as mind's essence), physics (opposing atomists), and even argued that Descartes' principles favored sensory foundation for knowledge, rejecting rationalist epistemology which often dominates in Descartes' work.
### Category: logic-intuitionistic
Question: What is Weak Kripke's Schema (WKP) and how does it relate to Brouwer's theory of the creating subject?
Answer:Weak Kripke's Schema (WKP) is a principle that Kripke preferred in his interpretation of Brouwer's theory of the creating subject. However, WKP still conflicts with strong continuous choice.
### Category: knowledge-value
Question: What is the functional role of knowledge identified as by the philosophers Klemens Kappel, Christoph Kelp, and Patrick Rysiew?
Answer:The functional role of knowledge is identified as closure of inquiry by the philosophers Klemens Kappel, Christoph Kelp, and Patrick Rysiew.
### Category: einstein-philscience
Question: What was Einstein's view of realism according to the quote?
Answer:Einstein saw realism not as a philosophical doctrine about the interpretation of scientific theories or the semantics of theoretical terms, but rather as a physical postulate.
### Category: mereology
Question: What is the view that there is no objective fact of the matter as to whether an object is part of another object, due to vagueness in the objects themselves, not in our descriptions?
Answer:This view is known as de re indeterminacy or worldly indeterminacy, which suggests that there are vague entities relative to which the parthood relation is not fully determined, leading to indeterminacy in statements about parts and wholes. This idea has been explored by several philosophers in recent literature, despite criticisms from early thinkers such as Russell (1923), Dummett (1975), Lewis (1986b), and Jackson (2001). Some argue that such a notion might have implications on mereological theses as discussed in previous sections, while others believe that it may not be ruled out a priori.
### Category: fideism
Question: What is the point of disagreement between Bishop and Evans regarding fideism?
Answer:Bishop and Evans agree that some version of fideism is justifiable on moral and/or rational grounds, but they disagree about whether what is believed by faith requires external evidential support. Specifically, Bishop and Evans dispute philosophical assumptions about belief entitlement.
### Category: brentano
Question: What does Brentano believe about the relationship between philosophical disciplines, such as aesthetics, and psychology?
Answer:Brentano believes that philosophical disciplines, including aesthetics, are rooted in psychology and would wither without it. He explicitly defends the claim that psychology is the theoretical science on which practical disciplines such as logic, ethics, and aesthetics are based.
### Category: sylvan-routley
Question: What issue does Sylvan identify as an insuperable difficulty for vegetarian options in light of ecological facts?
Answer:Sylvan identifies predation, specifically the killing of animals for food, as an insuperable difficulty for vegetarian options in light of ecological facts such as animal predation being an important, immensely frequent, and often desirable ecological fact, and the necessity of reducing numbers of certain animal species for vegetable growing to operate successfully.
### Category: suicide
Question: Who is often credited with offering the first justification of the Christian prohibition on suicide?
Answer:St. Augustine is often credited with offering the first justification of the Christian prohibition on suicide.
### Category: truth-pragmatic
Question: How does Peirce's view of truth evolve over time, according to Misak (2004)?
Answer:Peirce's view of truth evolves from referring to fate and unanimous agreement to focusing on scientific investigation and general consensus. He ultimately comes to see truth as what would be the result of scientific inquiry, if it were allowed to continue indefinitely.
### Category: telesio
Question: What is the primary objective of the spirit, according to Telesio's naturalist ethics in De rerum natura?
Answer:The primary objective of the spirit, according to Telesio's naturalist ethics in De rerum natura, is self-preservation and self-improvement, which is achieved through theoretical knowledge in natural philosophy and medicine, as well as through learning to control one's own emotions and desires.
### Category: properties
Question: What is discussed in the sixth section of the text?
Answer:In the sixth section of the text, the focus is on formal accounts of properties and their applications in natural language semantics and the foundations of mathematics, providing additional motivations for an ontological commitment to properties.
### Category: marxism-analytical
Question: What does the quote suggest about the reception of Cohen's interpretation of Marx's theory of history?
Answer:The quote suggests that Cohen's reading of Marx's theory of history has received significant criticism, with most criticisms centering around three main areas of concern. However, it does not provide specific details about the nature of these concerns or the content of the critical literature.
### Category: consciousness-intentionality
Question: What do some philosophers in the nineteen nineties argue is the determinant of phenomenal character of experience?
Answer:Some philosophers in the nineteen nineties argue that phenomenal character of experience is essentially determined by causal environmental connections. This view combines acceptance of externalism about content with a rejection of internalism about phenomenal character.
### Category: truthlikeness
Question: What is another name for the epistemic estimate of degree of truthlikeness on the evidence, also known as expected degree of truthlikeness?
Answer:Niiniluoto calls it verisimilitude, but since verisimilitude is typically taken as a synonym for truthlikeness, we will stick with expected truthlikeness for the epistemic notion.
### Category: philo-larissa
Question: Why is it unlikely that Carneades accepted the conclusions of his arguments against Stoic epistemology?
Answer:There are several reasons to doubt that Carneades straightforwardly believed that nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any impression after arguing for these conclusions. First, such a position would be inconsistent since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view. Secondly, Carneades had no reason to accept Stoic assumptions about impressions, empiricism, knowledge, and psychological doctrine. Lastly, Carneades' dialectical method of argument suggests that his arguments were designed to show the inadequacies of Stoic views rather than as an endorsement of skepticism. Additionally, Carneades presented multiple incompatible responses to Stoic reductio arguments, further indicating a critique of Stoic epistemological views.
### Category: emilie-du-chatelet
Question: What area of philosophy does Descartes compare to the roots of a tree in his work Principles?
Answer:Descartes compares metaphysics to the roots of a tree in his work Principles, with physics being the trunk and other special sciences as branches emerging from the trunk.
### Category: al-ghazali
Question: What does al-Ghazâlî criticize traditional Sunni ethics for lacking?
Answer:Al-Ghazâlî criticizes traditional Sunni ethics for lacking a focus on developing praiseworthy character traits and instead being limited to compliance with religious law and following the example of the Prophet Muhammad. He sees traditional Sunni jurisprudents as being overly focused on worldly matters and not equipped to guide Muslims on the best way to gain salvation in the afterlife.
### Category: indexicals
Question: What kind of objections does David Austin raise against Lewis and Chisholm's views on belief?
Answer:David Austin raises objections against Lewis and Chisholm's views on belief by presenting detailed and putative counterexamples that focus on the descriptivist aspect of their theories. According to Austin, both Lewis and Chisholm hold that an agent's belief about an object other than herself involves grasping a property that descriptively determines that object, and Austin challenges this descriptivist stance.
### Category: dietrich-freiberg
Question: What is the role of similitude in Dietrich's hierarchy of being?
Answer:Similitude is what binds together the various members of Dietrich's hierarchy of being into a unified universe. It is the result of the essential order of causation, according to which every being in the universe is ordered to every other being as cause or effect. Thus, every creature in Dietrich's universe bears a relation of similitude to every other creature and to the primary unifying principle from which they emanate, God.
### Category: wright
Question: What is Wright's view on the role of sense data in science?
Answer:Wright refuses to theorize about sense data and instead grounds empiricism in the type of data available to everyday perceiving.
### Category: consciousness-17th
Question: Was there any philosophical development related to consciousness in England that was similar to what was happening in continental Europe during the same time period?
Answer:Yes, there were similar developments towards a theory of consciousness in England during the time period when continental Europe was also focusing on this area.
### Category: bounded-rationality
Question: What could be a potential consequence of changing the normative standards from Peano to ZFC+ when adapting a pedagogy for teaching arithmetic to children?
Answer:A potential consequence of changing the normative standards from Peano to ZFC+ when adapting a pedagogy for teaching arithmetic to children is that some methods used in teaching full arithmetic may not be effective in teaching cardinal arithmetic, leading to a change in teaching methods.
### Category: moral-anti-realism
Question: Can a moral naturalist also be a moral anti-realist?
Answer:Yes, a moral naturalist can also be a moral anti-realist if they maintain that moral facts are not objective in nature. For example, a simplistic non-objectivist theory that identifies moral goodness with whatever a person approves of would be a form of anti-realism (in virtue of its non-objectivism), but since the phenomenon of people approving of things is something that can be accommodated smoothly within a scientific framework, it would also be a form of moral naturalism.
### Category: qm-bohm
Question: What is one condition for the conditional wave function of a subsystem to obey Schrödinger's equation?
Answer:One condition for the conditional wave function of a subsystem to obey Schrödinger's equation is that the subsystem is suitably decoupled from its environment, and that the total wave function has a special form called an effective product form.
### Category: pico-della-mirandola
Question: What were the four traditional layers of meaning given to biblical texts in early Christian hermeneutics?

### Category: logic-infinitary
Question: What is a condition for a transitive set A to be admissible?
Answer:If A is a transitive set such that <A, ∈ | A> is a model of ZFC, then A is admissible.
### Category: self-knowledge-externalism
Question: What type of support might the externalist view of memory receive according to Tye in the given scenario?
Answer:The externalist view of memory might receive intuitive support according to Tye in the given scenario, as Oscar judges things consistently after the switch. This could suggest that memory is not solely dependent on internal states.
### Category: laozi
Question: What is the role of nonaction (wuwei) in Daoist ethics and how does it relate to personal fulfillment and sociopolitical order?
Answer:Nonaction (wuwei) in Daoist ethics has the transformative power that ensures personal fulfillment and sociopolitical order, which goes against a strictly mystical reading of Laozi that associates mysticism with personal union with the Dao transcending all political interests. The concept of "virtue," whether interpreted in terms of authenticity or the purity and fullness of qi-energy, depicts a pristine natural and sociopolitical order in which naturalness and nonaction (wuwei) are the norm.
### Category: secession
Question: What is the difference between unilateral and consensual secession?
Answer:Unilateral secession is secession without the consent of the state from which a portion of territory is taken by the seceding group or without constitutional sanction. On the other hand, consensual secession is secession with the consent of the state from which a portion of territory is taken by the seceding group and with constitutional sanction.
### Category: mill-moral-political
Question: Who were some of Mill's critics that noted an apparent inconsistency between his higher pleasures doctrine and hedonism as traditionally formulated?
Answer:Mill's critics who noted this inconsistency included Sidgwick, F.H. Bradley, T.H. Green, and G.E. Moore. Green's discussion of Mill's explanation of the preferences of competent judges is especially instructive in this regard.
### Category: spinoza-modal
Question: What does Garrett's interpretation of Spinoza's denial in Ip28 imply about the relationship between finite modes and God's absolute nature?
Answer:Garrett's interpretation of Spinoza's denial in Ip28 implies that while no particular finite mode follows from God's absolute nature independently of its relations to other finite objects, it is still possible for the entire collection of finite modes as a whole to follow from the absolute nature of God or from an infinite mode of God.
### Category: lyotard
Question: What is Lyotard's position on social construction and language games' validity?
Answer:Lyotard never argued that all was socially constructed or that all language games had equal validity. Instead, his work aimed to testify to what escapes language while acknowledging that we never stop attempting to articulate this excess.
### Category: organ-donation
Question: What is an objection to taking organs without explicit consent of the deceased that is based on people's rights over their bodies?
Answer:The objection is that people's rights over their bodies establish a duty of non-interference which can be lifted only with the consent of the rightholder. This implies that taking organs without consent would be a violation of this right, even if the deceased had wanted to donate.
### Category: rigid-designators
Question: What is the objection that Kripke addresses regarding discussing an individual in a possible world without a qualitative criterion of identity?
Answer:The objection is that we cannot meaningfully talk about an individual with respect to another possible world without first having some qualitative criterion of identity, some qualitatively distinguishing mark that allows us to pick out that individual from other objects in the world at issue. This criterion would appeal to the individual's essence in order to assign their name to the right person as the individual that satisfies the qualitative criterion in any given possible world. The worry is that we know of no such qualitative criterion so we can not meaningfully discuss an individual in relation to any merely possible world.
### Category: meaning
Question: Can you name two books where Robert Brandom has developed his inferentialist viewpoint?
Answer:Robert Brandom has developed his inferentialist viewpoint in his books "Making It Explicit" (1994) and "Articulating Reasons" (2000).
### Category: dirty-hands
Question: What does the philosopher Walzer suggest about the justification of violating moral rules in the context of supreme emergency, and is he consistent in his application of this justification to both state and non-state actors?
Answer:Walzer suggests that it is permissible to violate moral rules in the context of supreme emergency, but he is biased towards state actors in his discussion of this concept. He is hesitant to allow soldiers and statesmen to override the rights of innocent people for their own political community, but he is skeptical of similar justifications offered by non-state actors who use terrorism. This inconsistency is evident in his different treatment of the no alternative and last resort justifications offered by governments and non-state agents in supreme emergency situations.
### Category: abu-bakr-al-razi
Question: What is the role of the Soul in al-Rāzī's philosophy?
Answer:In al-Rāzī's philosophy, the Soul serves as the source of life in bodies and facilitates a distinctive theodicy by initiating the process of the world's creation, while God intervenes to make the world as good as it can be. This explanation is intended to solve the problem of great suffering in the world and to reconcile it with the aforementioned good design of that world.
### Category: causation-physics
Question: What is the main point of contention in the metaphysical project's debate about the asymmetry of radiation phenomena?
Answer:The main point of contention in this debate is whether the asymmetry of radiation phenomena is an expression of a fundamental causal asymmetry, or if it is due to an asymmetry between prevailing initial and final conditions.
### Category: darwinism
Question: What is Charles Darwin's expression of regret at the beginning of chapter 5 of On the Origin of Species regarding the generation of variation?
Answer:The opening lines of chapter 5 of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin express his regret about discussing the generation of variation, as he feels it is a subject that he has not adequately covered.
### Category: diagrams
Question: What is the significance of the line in Venn-II diagrams as opposed to Venn-I diagrams?
Answer:The line in Venn-II diagrams allows for the connection of diagrams and the expression of disjunctive information between universal statements or between universal and existential statements, which is not possible with Venn-I diagrams.
### Category: idealism
Question: What does James characterize as not being true reality but rather appearance in his work?
Answer:James characterizes the reality that is arranged into relations and qualities as not being true reality but rather appearance in his work.
### Category: type-theory-intuitionistic
Question: What is the structure of a judgment in intuitionistic type theory when the judgment is about implication?
Answer:In intuitionistic type theory, a judgment about implication has the form "\(A \Rightarrow \U\) and either \(a \Rightarrow \N\) or \(a \Rightarrow \Pi x {:} b. c\) where furthermore \(\vdash b {:} \U\) and \(x {:} b \vdash c {:} \U\)." This judgment states that either \(a\) is a proof of \(\N\) (the natural numbers) or \(a\) is a proof of \(\Pi x {:} b. c\), which means that \(a\) is a function that takes an argument \(x\) of type \(b\) and returns a proof of \(c\), where \(c\) is of type \(\U\) (the universe of types). Additionally, \(b\) is also of type \(\U\).
### Category: evidence
Question: What is one consequence of the potential complexity of the relationships between pieces of evidence in justifying a belief?
Answer:One consequence of such complexity is our fallibility in responding appropriately to evidence when justifying a belief. This fallibility arises due to the possibility of defeat of evidence by further evidence at later points in time, which might restore initial justification afforded by original evidence.
### Category: scientific-representation
Question: What do some philosophers call the practice of taking scientific models literally, even if they are not real?
Answer:Some philosophers call this practice "face value practice".
### Category: life-meaning
Question: Why do some argue that an afterlife is necessary for life to be meaningful?
Answer:Some argue that an afterlife is necessary for life to be meaningful because they believe that justice is necessary for a meaningful life and that justice can only be achieved in an afterlife where all injustices are rectified. This idea is based on the belief that life seems nonsensical when the wicked flourish and the righteous suffer, at least in cases where there is no other world in which these injustices will be corrected by a higher power such as God or a Karmic force.
### Category: dewey
Question: What was the religious background and experience of John Dewey during his early adulthood?
Answer:John Dewey was raised in a religious family with a particularly devout mother. They belonged to the Congregationalist church during his childhood, but he later found Liberal Evangelicalism more acceptable in college. At twenty-one years old, Dewey reportedly had a mystical experience in Oil City, Pennsylvania to his friend Max Eastman.
### Category: qt-quantcomp
Question: How long do researchers expect it will take to build a quantum computer that can achieve quantum advantage over classical alternatives?
Answer:Researchers expect that it will take 5-10 years to build a quantum computer that can achieve quantum advantage over known classical alternatives for certain applications, such as optimization problems and digital quantum simulation.
### Category: sellars
Question: What is the role of intention in Sellars' analysis of norms and how does it differ from a volition?
Answer:In Sellars' analysis of norms, the central role is played by the notion of an intention. An intention is a thought that motivates one to realize its content, whereas a volition is an intention that has come to fruition. A volition has intentional content but also causally affects one's behavior, often accompanied by the first stirrings of activity. In other words, an intention is a mental state that can motivate action, while a volition is an intention that has already resulted in a commitment to act.
### Category: climate-science
Question: What is the level of confidence the IPCC has in their conclusion that more than half of the increase in global mean surface temperature since 1950 is due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions?
Answer:The IPCC has an "extremely likely" level of confidence in this conclusion, which corresponds to a probability greater than 0.95.
### Category: rights
Question: Why are status-based rights considered to be strongly held and robust?
Answer:Status-based rights are strongly held and robust because they are anchored in individual dignity, unlike instrumental rights which depend on calculations of consequences. This anchoring in dignity provides a firm foundation for their strength and near-absolute nature, reflecting the high value placed on each person.
### Category: medieval-haecceity
Question: How does Scotus differ from Aquinas in their account of common natures?
Answer:Scotus ascribes to bare nature a kind of entity and unity short of numerical unity, while Aquinas does not attribute any kind of entity or unity to it. Instead, Aquinas considers the nature in itself to lack numerical unity and any kind of being.
### Category: mereology
Question: What is the significance of extensionality in understanding the unique relevance of certain sums in the given principles?
Answer:Extensionality is significant in understanding the unique relevance of certain sums in the given principles because in its presence, the relevant sums must be unique. This means that extensionality helps in ensuring that there is only one correct sum or outcome when applying these principles.
### Category: trust
Question: What is one response to the first criticism of Baier's theory of trust, which is that goodwill alone is not sufficient for trustworthiness?
Answer:One response to this criticism is that trust involves not just the belief that the trustee will display goodwill towards us, but also the belief that they owe us goodwill (Cogley 2012). This is because a confidence trickster, who does not believe that their mark owes them goodwill, would not trust them and would not find them trustworthy.
### Category: natural-law-theories
Question: What is the standard for assessing reasonableness when the subject matter of the descriptive general account is some practice or institution devised by reason?
Answer:The standard for assessing reasonableness is the set of criteria of reasonableness that the descriptive theorist would use in dealing with similar practical issues in his or her own life.
### Category: propositional-function
Question: What is the logical statement expressed in the sentence, in terms of formal logic?
Answer:The logical statement expressed in the sentence is “c ∈ C ↔ c ∉ C”, where “c” is an element and “C” is a set.
### Category: civic-education
Question: What is a potential key element of civic education in a deliberative democracy theory?
Answer:A potential key element of civic education in a deliberative democracy theory is learning to talk and listen with other people about public problems through discussing current events with a moderator and some requirement to prepare in advance.
### Category: action
Question: What does the Davidson/Anscombe thesis imply about the relationship between an agent's act of moving his leg and his act of trying to move that leg?
Answer:According to the Davidson/Anscombe thesis, the agent's act of moving his leg = his act of trying to move that leg. So, perhaps the act of trying to move the leg doesn't cause the act of moving after all, since they are just the same.
### Category: molyneux-problem
Question: What measures did some French philosophes propose to overcome issues with Cheselden's account of cataract operations?
Answer:Some French philosophes proposed measures such as preparing the patient carefully for the operation and interrogation, allowing time for eye recovery post-operation, providing opportunities for dark exercise of eyes, and avoiding leading questions to overcome issues with Cheselden's account of cataract operations.
### Category: natural-properties
Question: How does McDaniel propose to define naturalness in value-theoretic terms?
Answer:McDaniel proposes that for a property to be "fundamental," i.e. natural, is for there to be a prima facie obligation to form true beliefs about it. He uses a theory of propositions as structured entities to address the challenge that naturalness applies also to properties and relations, not just beliefs.
### Category: emily-elizabeth-constance-jones
Question: What is the problem addressed in Russell's work "The Existential Import of Propositions" regarding singular terms?
Answer:The problem addressed in Russell's work "The Existential Import of Propositions" is the issue of vacuous singular terms, where a singular term does not refer to any existing entity. Russell's theory of denoting concepts is applied to show how such terms can still have meaning despite failing to denote anything existent.
### Category: chinese-phil-science
Question: What criticism has been leveled against Needham's approach to the history of science in China?
Answer:Needham's approach of fitting Chinese scientific tradition into the categories of twentieth-century western science has been criticized as anachronistic and culturally inappropriate, as it may not accurately reflect the unique characteristics of Chinese science and culture.
### Category: royce
Question: Why is it important for someone applying Royce's philosophy to contemporary problems to be aware of the racist assumptions in his work?
Answer:Being aware of the racist assumptions in Royce's work is important for anyone applying his philosophy to contemporary problems in order to understand why he included these assumptions and make a conscious effort to avoid them in their own thinking, as these assumptions may not be applicable or acceptable in modern contexts.
### Category: vegetarianism
Question: What could be the case such that there is no need to explain why it is wrong to consume wrongfully produced food?
Answer:It could be that there is nothing to explain if the statement that it is wrong to consume wrongfully produced food is self-evident or widely accepted as true. Alternatively, it could be that there is no explanation required if there is a lack of consensus or understanding about what constitutes wrongful food production.
### Category: macroevolution
Question: How does Grantham view the relationship between stochastic explanations of passive trends at the macro-level and more deterministic explanations at lower levels?
Answer:Grantham argues that these explanations need not conflict and that they can complement each other in understanding passive trends.
### Category: darwinism
Question: What is the test used to determine if two groups of individuals belong to different species?
Answer:The test to determine if two groups of individuals belong to different species is their incapacity to interbreed.
### Category: freedom-association
Question: What other values, besides freedom of association, can be pursued through limiting associative life?
Answer:The values that can be pursued through limiting associative life include security, equality, and economic efficiency, which may go beyond associative values altogether and instead focus on broader social goals.
### Category: equal-opportunity
Question: What is one potential practical function of affirmative action with disparate impact restrictions?
Answer:One potential practical function of affirmative action with disparate impact restrictions is that it can serve as a cost-effective means to address and prevent disparate treatment that might otherwise evade legal constraints. This is especially relevant in situations where disparate treatment is difficult to prove, as disparate impact may be easier to demonstrate. By doing so, such affirmative action policies aim to increase the extent to which the ideal of careers open to talents is achieved.
### Category: reid
Question: How does Reid approach the distinction between primary and secondary qualities in his arguments?
Answer:Reid approaches the distinction between primary and secondary qualities as a scientist of the mind rather than as a metaphysician in his arguments.
### Category: logical-constants
Question: What is a limitation of the permutation invariance criterion when it comes to handling intensional operators in modal and temporal logics?
Answer:The permutation invariance criterion, as it has been stated so far, only applies to extensional operators and connectives. Therefore, it is of no help in deciding whether operators such as the necessity operator in S4 modal logic or the H operator in temporal logic are bona fide logical constants. The invariance criterion can be extended to handle intensional operators by relativizing truth not just to an assignment of values to variables but also to a possible world and a time. However, this extended criterion can be quite stringent and may not count certain operators as logical constants if they are sensitive to structure on the domains of worlds and times, as is the case with the S4 necessity operator and the H operator in temporal logic.
### Category: sriharsa
Question: What issue does Śrīharṣa raise against the definition of knowledge that involves being aware of a distinctive property X?
Answer:Śrīharṣa argues that this definition of knowledge fails to satisfy the criterion of uniformity, as the relevant distinctive mark (property X) will vary from one case to another, making it impossible to uniformly characterize this property X that an agent needs to be aware of in order to have knowledge.
### Category: insolubles
Question: What is the main idea behind Marsilius's solution to insolubles?
Answer:Marsilius's main idea is that every proposition has two significations: a material signification, which is its normal or ordinary meaning about things, and a formal signification, which is meta-linguistic. Affirmative propositions signify that their subject and predicate supposit for the same thing, while negatives signify that they don't. In the case of an insoluble such as 'This proposition is false', its material signification contradicts its formal signification, causing it to falsify itself due to self-contradiction.
### Category: wolff-christian
Question: What is the distinction between real individuals and nominal beings in Wolff's philosophy?
Answer:Real individuals are complete and determinate, meaning that every aspect or determination of a thing can be specified and that its determinations are sufficient to individuate it from all other things. On the other hand, nominal beings are indeterminate, which means that although there is a certain set of specifiable determinations that is sufficient to pick out a given possible thing among all possible things, the total set of its determinations is not specifiable. Additionally, while essentialia and attributes are necessary properties of real individuals, modes are contingent or accidental properties, and in the case of nominal beings, existence is a mode that may or may not be present.
### Category: abilities
Question: What is the difference between general ability and specific ability?
Answer:General ability refers to a broad capability that an agent possesses, while specific ability refers to a more narrow capability that is relevant to a specific situation or context.
### Category: plato-ethics
Question: What is the reason Plato does not concern himself with making his ideal city more livable according to the text?
Answer:Plato does not concern himself with making his ideal city more livable because his aim is to present a model and work out its essential features, not to predict and explain the course of history or to create a city that is actually livable for its citizens.
### Category: heredity
Question: Why does population stratification increase the likelihood of false positive SNPs in GWAS?
Answer:Population stratification increases the likelihood of false positive SNPs in GWAS because human populations exhibit ethnic or cultural subgroups with distinct allele frequencies. This means that if a GWAS is not properly controlled for population stratification, it may incorrectly identify SNPs as associated with a trait when they are actually just more common in one subgroup than another.
### Category: dewey
Question: What is the relationship between datum and ideatum, according to James?
Answer:According to James, datum and ideatum are cooperative instrumentalities for economical dealing with the problem of the maintenance of the integrity of experience, with datum referring to given existence and ideatum to inferred existence.
### Category: paradoxes-contemporary-logic
Question: What is the role of paradoxes in Gödel's construction of formally undecidable sentences?
Answer:Paradoxes played a heuristic role in Gödel's construction of formally undecidable sentences. He related his construction to epistemological paradoxes such as the Richard antinomy. However, self-reference only became a powerful mathematical tool when non-trivial number-theoretic techniques were used in its analysis. Self-reference in the indirect sense, where formulas express properties of their own "name," does not result in dangerous circularity.
### Category: logic-informal
Question: What is the simplest criterion for good arguments in informal logic, involving an analogy of soundness?
Answer:In informal logic, the simplest criterion for good arguments is that they justify their conclusion by providing strong, credible reasons for believing it. This involves acceptable premises and a conclusion that follows from them using an appropriate form of validity (deductively, inductively, conductively, or abductively). This criterion can be summarized as T = {A,V}, where A is an account of premise acceptability and V is an account of informal validity.
### Category: spacetime-singularities
Question: What would be a possible trajectory of a massive body that would never age beyond a certain point in its existence?
Answer:A timelike path incomplete with respect to proper time in the future direction would represent this kind of trajectory.
### Category: thick-ethical-concepts
Question: What is one problem with viewing the evaluations conveyed by thick terms as conventional implicatures?
Answer:One problem is that conventional implicatures are not defeasible in the same ways that evaluations conveyed by thick terms seem to be. For example, the sentence "Whether or not Shaq's agility is unexpected given his tallness, Shaq is tall but agile" sounds odd if we take the evaluation of agility as a conventional implicature of "but."
### Category: fuller-margaret
Question: Who is the woman that is expected to appear and vindicate the birthright for all women, teaching them what to claim and how to use what they obtain, according to Fuller (1845)?
Answer:The woman who is expected to appear and vindicate the birthright for all women, teaching them what to claim and how to use what they obtain, according to Fuller (1845) is one who will advocate for women's rights and empower them with knowledge.
### Category: bentham
Question: Who was responsible for introducing utilitarian ideas into legal education in America and encouraging its translation into English?
Answer:David Hoffman first introduced utilitarian ideas into legal education in America at the University of Maryland in the early 1820s. He also encouraged John Neal to translate Bentham's Traités into English, which began during Neal's eighteen-month stay with Bentham in London in 1825-26, although only the introductory sections of the Traités appeared in Neal's Principles of Legislation (1830).
### Category: knowledge-acquaindescrip
Question: What is the view of the acquaintance theorist regarding the existence of doubts and disagreements about what is supposed to be immediately present to consciousness?
Answer:The acquaintance theorist views the existence of doubts and disagreements about what is supposed to be immediately present to consciousness as an opportunity to address profound puzzles about the nature of the given and its epistemic role, rather than as a source of embarrassment. According to the acquaintance theorist, not everything about the given or its role is itself given, even if something is indubitable.
### Category: hume
Question: Where can be found Hume's contributions to the critical phase of the causation debate in his Treatise?

Question: What is the term used to describe a proof that is conveyed through an image or diagram?
Answer:A proof that is conveyed through an image or diagram is often called a "picture proof".
### Category: critical-phil-race
Question: How can the social construction of race be seen in relation to an individual's self-making on the view that external forces construct social identities as a way to divide and rank?
Answer:On this view, while an individual is categorized and grouped by political systems into races, with a subsequently curtailed (or magnified) agency, they still have the freedom to engage in self-making apart from their socially constructed racial identity.
### Category: physics-experiment
Question: What factors, according to Collins, play a role in breaking the regress in evaluating scientific hypotheses and theories?
Answer:According to Collins, the regress in evaluating scientific hypotheses and theories is broken by factors such as the career, social, and cognitive interests of the scientists, and the perceived utility for future work. These factors drive the negotiation within the scientific community, which is not decided by what we might call epistemological criteria or reasoned judgment.
### Category: chemistry
Question: Why is Nagel's account of reduction considered unrealistic and inapplicable to actual science by many?
Answer:Nagel's account of reduction is considered unrealistic and inapplicable to actual science by many because of the logical requirements it assumes, which are thought to be too strict for real-world scientific practice. This critique is not only present in the philosophy of chemistry literature but has also been made by critics of reductionist theses in other scientific disciplines, such as Davidson (1970) and Kitcher (1984).
### Category: perception-disjunctive
Question: What is the definition of 'equivalent' that Snowdon suggests in the context of Hinton's argument?
Answer:According to Snowdon, 'P' is equivalent to 'Q' if and only if it is a priori that necessarily (P if and only if Q).
### Category: philoponus
Question: What is one of the main arguments made by Philoponus in his book On the Eternity of the World against Proclus?
Answer:In his book On the Eternity of the World against Proclus, Philoponus argues that creation out of nothing is possible and is compatible with Christian doctrine. He also attempts to refute Proclus within the framework of Platonist philosophy and keeps biblical theology out of his polemic.
### Category: schlegel-aw
Question: Why is Schlegel's translation of Shakespeare's works considered to be among the best in German, despite criticisms of romanticization and subjectivity?
Answer:Schlegel's translation of Shakespeare's works is considered to be among the best in German due to his deep understanding of Shakespeare's language and style, as well as his ability to convey the meaning and spirit of the original texts in a way that resonates with German audiences, despite some criticisms regarding subjectivity and romanticization. His translations have stood the test of time and remain highly regarded in German literary circles.
### Category: liar-paradox
Question: What is the Liar paradox referred to as, in relation to being a central issue in the development of non-classical logics?
Answer:The Liar paradox is sometimes referred to as a "locus of thinking about non-classical logics," as it has been an impetus for considering alternative logical principles to classical logic.
### Category: consciousness
Question: What potential benefit does consciousness in the meta-mental sense have for social coordination?
Answer:Consciousness in the meta-mental sense may provide an enhanced understanding of the mental states of other minded creatures, particularly those within one's social group. This understanding can lead to increased capacity for social coordination.
### Category: decision-capacity
Question: What objection is raised against the idea that mental capacity can vary according to external circumstances?
Answer:The objection raised is that it is counterintuitive and goes against our intuition. Additionally, some critics argue that mental capacity is fixed and cannot vary based on external circumstances.
### Category: anderson-john
Question: What was one of the consequences of Anderson's affiliation with the Australian Communist Party?

### Category: disability-health
Question: What qualities must friends share according to Aristotle's account of friendship in Nicomachean Ethics?
Answer:According to Aristotle, friends in the highest or truest form of friendship must share similarity of character. However, contemporary accounts of friendship place less emphasis on equality or similarity of specific traits and more on equality of respect, investment, and commitment.
### Category: world-government
Question: What does Rawls not endorse with his rejection of world government?
Answer:With his rejection of world government, Rawls does not endorse the conventional system of sovereign states or the contemporary international order, which he sees as having extreme injustices, crippling poverty, and inequalities. However, his rejection of a world government does not negate the legitimacy and desirability of establishing international or transnational institutions to regulate cooperation between peoples and even to discharge certain common inter-societal duties.
### Category: stein
Question: What does Edith Stein believe is the relationship between married women and religious vocation?
Answer:Edith Stein supported the idea that married women could practice their religious vocation. She believed that there is no dogma preventing women’s ordination and that the contemporary Church has need of “feminine energies”.
### Category: computational-complexity
Question: Are the classes NP and coNP different from each other?
Answer:Yes, it is currently believed that the classes NP and coNP are indeed distinct, but this has not been definitively proven.
### Category: lawphil-nature
Question: Why might someone argue that a theory of law must be inherently evaluative?
Answer:One might argue that a theory of law must be inherently evaluative because it needs to account for the internal point of view that legal practitioners adopt towards the law, which involves a positive evaluation of the law as justified or providing reasons for action. Since a critical mass of participants in legal practice must adopt this internal point of view for it to genuinely count as law, any adequate legal theory must account for this evaluative stance, making it inherently evaluative as well.
### Category: prediction-accommodation
Question: Why does Popper believe ad hoc hypotheses reduce the testability of theories?
Answer:Popper argues that ad hoc hypotheses reduce the testability of theories because they lack independent testability and fail to increase the falsifiability of the theories they modify.
### Category: innateness-language
Question: What is the unique ability of the human Faculty of Language by Numbers (FLN) according to Hauser et al.?
Answer:The unique ability of the human Faculty of Language by Numbers (FLN) is its power of recursion, which is the ability to categorize linguistic objects into hierarchically organized classes and to generate infinitely many sentences out of finitely many words.
### Category: thomas-kuhn
Question: How does Thomas Kuhn argue that observation is influenced in science?
Answer:Thomas Kuhn argues that observation in science is influenced by prior beliefs and experiences, such that two scientists observing the same scene may not make the same theory-neutral observations. This is known as the thesis of the theory-dependence of observation.
### Category: cancer
Question: Why is it unclear which causal factor(s) should figure centrally in classifying cancers?
Answer:It is unclear which causal factor(s) should figure centrally in classifying cancers because there could be hundreds or thousands of cancer types and subtypes depending on how fine-grained a characterization of the causal basis of cancer one adopts. Additionally, there might not be an obvious choice of causal basis that best reflects anything like a "natural" division of type and subtypes. The classification of multifactorial diseases like cancer may not be univocal or reflect any inherent "naturalness."
### Category: reduction-biology
Question: What is the study of how different scientific theories and disciplines, such as biology and physics, relate to each other and potentially reduce to each other?
Answer:The philosophy of intertheory relations in physics studies how different scientific theories and disciplines relate to each other and potentially reduce to each other, with a focus on the relationship between biology and physics.
### Category: turing-machine
Question: What is the role of the letter 'u' in the PRINT\_COMPLETE\_CONFIGURATION operation of the Turing machine described?
Answer:In the PRINT\_COMPLETE\_CONFIGURATION operation of the Turing machine described, the letter 'u' is used to determine the move (R, L, N) that is needed, and its mark is erased after being checked.
### Category: egalitarianism
Question: What is the final requirement for implementing equality of opportunity that goes beyond legal enactments?
Answer:The final requirement for implementing equality of opportunity that goes beyond legal enactments is that purchasers of goods and services should be responsive only to the price and quality of the goods offered to them for purchase, and not to the ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the maker or seller of the good.
### Category: process-philosophy
Question: What is a significant point of division among contemporary process philosophers?
Answer:Contemporary process philosophers are fundamentally divided over whether there is an issue that is being poorly conceived or approached in process philosophy.
### Category: church-turing
Question: What is another common misconception, besides the maximality thesis, that is often mistakenly associated with Turing's results in modern writing on computability and the brain?
Answer:The simulation thesis is another common misconception that is often mistakenly associated with Turing's results in modern writing on computability and the brain. This thesis asserts that the brain and any biological or physical system can be simulated by a Turing machine.
### Category: moral-character
Question: How does Rawls argue that just institutions can instill in individuals a desire to act justly?
Answer:Rawls argues that just institutions can instill in individuals a desire to act justly by creating an environment that allows people to experience the enjoyment of their own and others' realized powers through shared activities with others. As people develop their abilities, they form attachments and friendships with their community and institutions that promote their good. This leads to a stable sense of their own value based on their own accomplishments and status as equal citizens. With this stable sense of self-worth and hope in achieving their aims, citizens will want to act justly for the right reasons and will not be prone to negative emotions such as rancor, jealousy, and hostile envy.
### Category: computational-complexity
Question: What is the condition that must be met for \(\textbf{PH}\) to be a proper hierarchy in the context of computational complexity theory?
Answer:\(\textbf{PH}\) is a proper hierarchy if for all \(k\), \(\Sigma^P_{k} \subsetneq \Sigma^P_{k+1}\) and \(\Sigma^P_{k} \neq \Pi^P_{k}\).
### Category: gersonides
Question: Why are certain communications received more clearly than others, according to Gersonides?
Answer:According to Gersonides, certain communications are received more clearly than others due to the constitutional perfection of the imaginative faculty. A constitutionally perfect imaginative faculty is able to receive information from both dominant and weak heavenly bodies, while a constitutionally imperfect imaginative faculty is only able to receive information from dominant heavenly bodies. This difference in the source of information received results in differences in the overall quality of the information received in the two cases.
### Category: justice-inequality-health

### Category: butler-moral
Question: What is the main focus of Butler's first three sermons in presenting his moral philosophy?
Answer:The main focus of Butler's first three sermons is to provide a general framework for his moral philosophy through a teleological account of human nature, arguing that self-love and benevolence or virtue—principles that other moral philosophers have seen as in tension—are not only not in tension but mutually supporting when properly understood.
### Category: dewey
Question: What is the purpose of Dewey's schematic pattern of inquiry and how does it relate to actual cases of reasoning?
Answer:Dewey's schematic pattern of inquiry outlines how exemplary cases of inquiry unfold, particularly in empirical sciences. However, it is not meant as a summary of how people always think but rather as a guide for how they ought to think in order to conduct exemplary inquiry.
### Category: bolzano-logic
Question: What does Peirce suggest might be a possible definition of grounding in a conceptual science?

### Category: epsilon-calculus
Question: When were the ideas of the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution method first presented by Hilbert?
Answer:The ideas of the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution method were first presented by Hilbert in his Hamburg lecture in 1921 (1922).
### Category: scientific-discovery
Question: How does generative justification, as characterized in the methodology of discovery, relate to consequential justification in science?
Answer:Generative justification complements consequential justification in science by providing an important form of justification that involves reasoning to a claim from data or previously established results more generally, as opposed to deriving empirical support for a theory solely from successfully testing its predictive consequences based on appropriate auxiliary assumptions.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: How does Gödel's proof contribute to the development of computability theory by demonstrating an effective form of Cantor's diagonal argument?
Answer:Gödel's proof contributes to computability theory by showcasing how to formalize the substitution of terms for free variables, leading to an effective form of Cantor's diagonal argument. This technique is pivotal in understanding results such as the undecidability of the Halting Problem, the Recursion Theorem, and the Hierarchy Theorem.
### Category: sociobiology
Question: What type of discourse is this quote initiating?
Answer:This quote is initiating a discourse that addresses philosophical criticisms of behavioral ecology and its methods.
### Category: logic-nonmonotonic
Question: Why does skeptical consequence based on Reiter's notion of extension not exhibit cautious monotonicity?
Answer:This is because if we consider the default theory (\emptyset, Δ), where Δ contains two defaults, skeptical consequence will not be cautiously monotonic. This is explained in Makinson (1994).
### Category: conscience
Question: Who were some philosophers who argued that the State has the power to enforce certain practices even when citizens claim that it would violate their conscience in order to protect social order?
Answer:Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, and John Locke were philosophers who argued that the State has the power to enforce certain practices even when citizens claim that it would violate their conscience in order to protect social order.
### Category: wodeham
Question: What is Zeno's argument for the impossibility of local motion, based on the infinite divisibility of space?
Answer:Zeno argues that if every space is infinitely divisible, then any moving object must traverse an infinite number of smaller spaces to cover the distance. Since traversing an infinite number of smaller spaces in a finite time is impossible, local motion (motion in a finite space) is impossible.
### Category: heredity
Question: What can be inferred about the heights of monozygotic and dizygotic twins if height is mostly influenced by environmental factors and heritability is low?
Answer:If height is mostly influenced by environmental factors and heritability is low, then monozygotic twins will be as different in height from one another as dizygotic twins.
### Category: natural-theology
Question: What do some philosophers argue regarding the justification of claiming metaphysical possibility?
Answer:Some philosophers argue that no presumption of metaphysical possibility is justified, especially regarding supersensible things. This stance is in response to the claim that we can rationally presume the real possibility of most things, including God.
### Category: moral-motivation
Question: What is the "direction of fit" distinction between belief and desire, and how does it relate to the Humean theory of motivation?
Answer:The "direction of fit" distinction is the idea that belief and desire differ in their relationship to the world. Beliefs aim to fit the world, while desires aim to change it. This distinction is relevant to the Humean theory of motivation because it is argued that belief states cannot entail desire states due to their incompatible directions of fit. The Humean theory asserts that motivation must involve desire, so any attempt to ground motivation in belief alone (as some anti-Humean theories do) would require mental states with incompatible directions of fit. The anti-Humeans argue that this incoherence can be resolved by considering that mental states can have opposing directions of fit, each directed at different propositions.
### Category: public-goods
Question: What negative consequence does the Groves-Clarke mechanism have?
Answer:The Groves-Clarke mechanism is expensive as it requires large payments to induce individuals to reveal their true value. Alternative mechanisms may avoid this expense but can result in social waste instead.
### Category: ramus
Question: What did the Aristotelians believe about the relationship between the different parts of the Organon and the fields of probability and certainty?
Answer:The Aristotelians believed that the different parts of the Organon corresponded to different parts of logic, with probability being dealt with in the Topics and certainty being addressed in the Prior and Posterior Analytics. They saw these as distinct and essential areas of logic.
### Category: tropes
Question: What is Moltmann's proposed alternative to the standard view of comparatives that refer to abstract objects?
Answer:Moltmann proposes understanding comparatives in terms of tropes, where "John is happier than Mary" is understood as "John's happiness exceeds Mary's happiness". This approach is preferred because it avoids the use of abstract entities such as degrees or sets of degrees.
### Category: peirce-logic
Question: What symbol does Peirce use to represent inclusion?
Answer:Peirce uses the symbol \(\inclusion\) to represent inclusion.
### Category: bell-theorem
Question: Why is there no temporal order between spacelike separated events in relativistic spacetime, according to Bell's analysis?
Answer:In Bell's analysis, there is no temporal order between spacelike separated events in relativistic spacetime because any system of coordinates will assign different time coordinates to such events, depending on the reference frame used. If all reference frames are taken to be physically equivalent, then there can be no objective temporal order between spacelike separated events. This is because relations that are not relativistically invariant have no physical significance, according to Bell's analysis.
### Category: scholem
Question: What is Scholem's position regarding the origin of experience in relation to language?
Answer:Scholem does not argue that language is the origin of experience, but rather views it as a vehicle for understanding experience. He never definitively argues this point and it remains a topic of debate among his interpreters.
### Category: evolution-cultural
Question: Can the development of new behaviors in non-human species always be clearly classified as either individual or social learning?
Answer:No, the development of new behaviors in non-human species cannot always be clearly classified as either individual or social learning. In some cases, as with the chimpanzees in Hobaiter et al.'s study, an individual may develop a new behavior through both individual learning (finding an old moss sponge) and social learning (building upon the past action of another chimp). This blurring of individual and social learning complicates the question of what culture consists in.
### Category: technology
Question: What philosophical tradition do cultural approaches to technology often align themselves with?
Answer:Cultural approaches to technology are often phenomenological in nature or position themselves in relation to phenomenology as post-phenomenology. Examples of philosophers in this tradition include Don Ihde, Albert Borgmann, Peter-Paul Verbeek, and Evan Selinger.
### Category: lawphil-naturalism
Question: How does Ross categorize linguistic utterances that represent states of affairs in the world?
Answer:Ross calls linguistic utterances that represent states of affairs in the world "assertions".
### Category: ayn-rand
Question: What are some views that can be considered as types of egoism where the egoist is not the sole intended beneficiary of morality?
Answer:The second and third views being referred to here are likely forms of egoism where the egoist is not the sole intended beneficiary of morality. However, without additional context it is difficult to be more specific about what these views might be. It is also possible that the second and third views being referred to are not typically classified as egoist views by most philosophers.
### Category: kant-aesthetics
Question: What concept does Reiter (2018) and Reiter and Geiger (2018) propose as a key to understanding the aesthetic ideas expressed by nature in Kant's theory?
Answer:Reiter (2018) and Reiter and Geiger (2018) propose the concept of an "aesthetic normal idea," introduced by Kant in the Third Moment at §17, 233, as a key to understanding the aesthetic ideas expressed by nature in Kant's theory. They relate this concept to a notion of "ideal form" that was current in art theory at Kant's time.

Question: What does Aristotle's account of homonymy allow in terms of overlap between different uses of the same term?
Answer:Aristotle's account of homonymy allows for partial overlap between different uses of the same term. This means that in some cases, the same term can be used in different ways that share some similarities but are not entirely identical.
### Category: qm-decoherence
Question: What is the measurement problem in quantum mechanics referring to in the wide sense?
Answer:In the wide sense, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics refers to the challenge of explaining what 'measurements' and 'results' are if quantum mechanics is not the fundamental theory that explains the phenomenology of quantum measurements.
### Category: weyl
Question: What is the difference between the space conceptions of Helmholtz and Lie as compared to a general Riemannian standpoint?
Answer:Helmholtz and Lie require homogeneity and isotropy for physical space, which are valid only in a matter-empty universe from a general Riemannian standpoint. In contrast, a universe that contains matter is inhomogeneous, anisotropic and of variable curvature in a Riemannian perspective.
### Category: ethics-cultural-heritage
Question: What is the political problem that arises from the fact of intranational cultural diversity?
Answer:The political problem of multiculturalism arises from the fact of intranational cultural diversity, which is the coexistence of multiple cultures within a single nation.
### Category: critical-theory
Question: What is the role of social facts in pragmatic social science with respect to political ideals?
Answer:Social facts play a crucial role in pragmatic social science as they cannot be ignored when it comes to the realizability and feasibility of political ideals. Social facts that challenge the institutional basis of modern political integration require normative practical inquiry to extend the scope of political possibilities rather than accepting them as fixed limits. Pragmatic social science seeks to demonstrate how political ideals, such as robust and deliberative self-rule, can still be possible and feasible under current conditions or with modifications.
### Category: social-norms
Question: What happens to trustees' behavior in Xiao and Bicchieri's experiment when reciprocity would increase payoff inequality?
Answer:A majority of trustees did not reciprocate the investors' transfer when doing so would increase payoff inequality (in the asymmetry treatment).
### Category: meaning-normativity
Question: What potential issue might arise if every instance of rule-guided belief formation requires the unguided formation of at least one other belief or intentional state for CD normativism?
Answer:This situation might be considered surprising for a defender of the view that belief is essentially governed by rules that can guide belief formation. It could potentially make CD normativism viable only if the force of the relevant rules or norms can be plausibly construed in complete independence of the attitudes of the thinkers.
### Category: polqar
Question: Why did the Talmudic Sages include popular knowledge in their teachings according to Polqar?
Answer:Polqar suggests that the Talmudic Sages deliberately included popular knowledge in their teachings to provide a pathway for those with limited understanding, allowing them to participate in true knowledge as well.
### Category: zermelo-set-theory
Question: How does Zermelo's paper introduce set theory?
Answer:Zermelo's paper introduces set theory as a fundamental theory, according to its introduction.
### Category: science-theory-observation
Question: Why does Laymon argue that Michelson and Morley could have assumed contraction in determining the length of the arms of their interferometer with no practical impact on their results?
Answer:Laymon argues that Michelson and Morley could have assumed contraction in determining the length of the arms of their interferometer with no practical impact on their results because the predicted fringe shift is calculated from the anticipated difference in the distance traveled by light in the two arms, which is the same whether or not higher order terms including contraction are neglected. Thus, either assuming contraction or not would have led to the same results.
### Category: chinese-legalism
Question: What is Han Fei's view on rulers who employ scholars based solely on their rhetorical skills and not on the political worth of their ideas?
Answer:Han Fei vehemently dislikes rulers who are fond of argumentativeness and of crafty words, and who employ proponents of mutually exclusive doctrines just out of admiration of their rhetorical skills, without any consideration of the doctrines’ political worth.
### Category: computational-linguistics
Question: What is one limitation of both HMMs and PCFGs in the context of natural language processing?
Answer:Both HMMs and PCFGs are generative models that suffer from insufficient sensitivity of local choices to the larger context in natural language processing tasks.
### Category: political-obligation
Question: Who did Robert Paul Wolff claim Kantian inspiration from for his philosophical anarchist views?
Answer:Robert Paul Wolff claimed Kantian inspiration for his philosophical anarchist views, which involves an a priori rejection of the possibility of political obligation. However, Immanuel Kant himself was not an anarchist and seemed to insist on an unqualified obligation to obey the law that goes beyond what most political philosophers nowadays will accept.
### Category: demonstration-medieval
Question: What principle does William of Ockham seem to refer to when he suggests that the causal power of a most specific natural kind can be known through the observation of a single instance?
Answer:William of Ockham seems to refer to the principle of the uniformity of nature when he suggests that the causal power of a most specific natural kind can be known through the observation of a single instance. This principle suggests that everything in a given most specific natural kind which acts produces effects of the same kind.
### Category: intuition
Question: What types of doubts could arise when there are widespread disagreements on intuitions, particularly on views where intuition reliability is constitutive of possessing certain concepts?
Answer:When there are widespread disagreements on intuitions, doubts may emerge about the honesty, competence, shared language, or even existence of other interlocutors. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding one's understanding of their mental contents, especially if the disagreement involves basic truths of arithmetic or other fundamental concepts.
### Category: sriharsa
Question: What consequence arises if the being-of-that-ness is considered part of the nature of the relation R in the given scenario?
Answer:If the being-of-that-ness is considered part of the nature of the relation R, then the object being related to should also be part of R's nature, which in turn implies that the object is part of the nature of the awareness-episode e. This leads to the threat of idealism, as the object is now part of the subjective experience.
### Category: aristotle-categories
Question: Can non-substantial particulars exist independently from primary substances, according to Aristotle's theory?
Answer:No, non-substantial particulars cannot exist independently from primary substances. They are dependent entities, individuated only by reference to the primary substance that they are present in. Hence, Socrates' whiteness cannot exist without Socrates himself.
### Category: wesley-salmon
Question: What contribution did John Clendinnen make regarding the justification of induction that was accepted as significant by Wesley Salmon?
Answer:John Clendinnen suggested a methodological simplicity that applies to rules instead of statements, requiring the adoption of the simplest system of predicting rules which are compatible with and exemplified in the set of known facts. This contribution was accepted as significant by Wesley Salmon in his justification of induction.
### Category: kant-social-political
Question: How does Kant differentiate between right and virtue in terms of the type of freedom they concern?
Answer:Right concerns outer freedom, while virtue concerns inner freedom or mastery over one's own passions.
### Category: persons-means
Question: Can treating someone merely as a means be considered acting wrongly in all cases? Provide an example where treating someone as a means does not seem to be acting wrongly.
Answer:No, treating someone merely as a means is not always acting wrongly. For instance, if a gangster considers a barista merely as a tool to get coffee and buys coffee from her, he treats her as a means, but it does not seem to be acting wrongly in this particular case (Parfit 2011: 216).
### Category: self-reference
Question: Why do problems arise when we try to formalize the intuitive understanding of semantics and set theory?
Answer:Problems arise because if we try to capture the intuitive understanding of these subjects in a formal system, we will find that the paradoxes can still be formulated within that system, leading to inconsistencies.
### Category: alain-locke
Question: Who does Locke claim speaks in distinctive overtones and represents unique experiences in the Harlem Renaissance?
Answer:Locke claims that young artists speak in distinctive overtones and represent unique experiences in the Harlem Renaissance, specifically young American Negroes whose experiences are uniquely representative.
### Category: mathematics-constructive

### Category: reid-ethics
Question: What is Reid's aim in distinguishing his view of moral knowledge from that of the rationalists?
Answer:Reid seeks to differentiate his account of moral knowledge from that of the rationalists by arguing that moral knowledge is not a type of theoretical knowledge like that obtained in mathematics. Instead, he argues that moral knowledge is derived from a moral sense that is distinct from reason.
### Category: moore
Question: What did Moore propose as an alternative to Russell's account of implication?
Answer:Moore proposed the term 'entailment' as an alternative to Russell's account of implication, recognizing its connection to logical necessity but arguing that it is not just a matter of the necessity of the truth-functional conditional.
### Category: spacetime-theories-classical
Question: What is Leibniz's resolution for the tension between the fundamental role of force/virtus and its association with Aristotelian form in his theory of mechanics?
Answer:Leibniz's resolution for this tension is to require that while considerations of force must determine the form of the laws of motion, the laws themselves should be such that one cannot determine the value of the force (and hence true speed). He holds that only quantities which can be determined are those of relative position and motion.
### Category: consciousness-temporal
Question: How does the Cinematic form of realism explain the continuity of consciousness?
Answer:The Cinematic form of realism explains the continuity of consciousness by positing that it is composed of a gap-free sequence of momentary or extremely brief states. This allows for continuous awareness for extended periods of time, such as hours at a stretch, accommodating the Modest Continuity Thesis.
### Category: logic-free
Question: What is an example of an n-place function symbol in logic?

### Category: organs-sale
Question: Can payment for organ donation automatically invalidate the consent given by the donor?
Answer:No, payment for organ donation does not automatically invalidate consent. The fact that payments encourage people to do things they otherwise would not do does not inherently mean that consent is not freely given.
### Category: atomism-ancient
Question: What were some philosophical issues discussed in response to Buddhist ideas about motion?
Answer:Philosophers discussed the persistence of macroscopic bodies, momentum or persisting tendencies of moving bodies, different directions exhibited by these tendencies in a rotating wheel, and the cohesion of particles within moving bodies in response to Buddhist ideas about motion.
### Category: dreams-dreaming
Question: In what context did Freud argue that dreams and waking life are similar?
Answer:Freud argued that dreams and waking life are similar in the context of psychoanalytic theory, suggesting that both involve unconscious desires and thoughts seeking expression or resolution. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a more specific answer.
### Category: hume-moral
Question: What type of government does Hume argue is less prone to corruption, faction, and oppressive treatment of people, thus more likely to enforce justice and encourage peace and prosperity?
Answer:Hume argues that a representative democracy of property-holders with division of powers and some features of federalism is less prone to corruption, faction, and oppressive treatment of people, thus more likely to enforce justice and encourage peace and prosperity.
### Category: vegetarianism
Question: What is the expectation expressed in regards to a product and its effects?
Answer:The expectation expressed is that consuming product P will result in the production of Q.
### Category: capability-approach
Question: What is the suggested advantage of starting a normative analysis from ends instead of means in terms of how means are valued?
Answer:Starting a normative analysis from ends rather than means ensures that means are valued only instrumentally, i.e., based on their contribution to expanding people's capabilities, rather than intrinsically. For example, money or economic growth will not be valued for their own sake but only insofar as they contribute to an expansion of people's capabilities. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the different types of means that are important for fostering and nurturing particular capabilities.
### Category: metaphor
Question: What is one example of an activity that involves coordination with an audience according to Lewis (1979), and what condition must be met for this coordination to amount to communication?
Answer:One example of an activity that involves coordination with an audience according to Lewis (1979) is joke-telling and metaphor-making. The condition that must be met for this coordination to amount to communication is that either the audience must be able to identify what the speaker is doing, or the speaker must be able to identify what the audience is doing.
### Category: truth-pluralist
Question: How do truths about objects other than the blobject correspond to those objects?
Answer:Truths about objects other than the blobject correspond to them indirectly.
### Category: neo-daoism

### Category: arendt
Question: What made Arendt realize the need to confront the challenge of human comprehension regarding atrocities?
Answer:Arendt was prompted by her participation in Eichmann's trial in the early sixties, which made her grapple with understanding how an ordinary, law-abiding individual could commit such heinous crimes. This experience led her to consider whether humans have an inherent independent faculty for judgment unsupported by law and public opinion.
### Category: truth
Question: How does Austin's correspondence theory define truth in relation to facts?
Answer:In Austin's correspondence theory, a statement corresponds to both a fact or situation and a type of situation. It is true if the fact or situation matches the type of situation specified in the statement.
### Category: fiction
Question: What does David Lewis suggest we should do in exceptional cases when considering the act of story-telling?
Answer:In such cases, David Lewis suggests considering those possible worlds where the act of story-telling is genuinely what it claims to be in our world, such as ravings or reliable translations of reliable sources. This approach enables us to evaluate the act of story-telling in various contexts and assess its implications accordingly.
### Category: bolzano
Question: What is an assumption made for simplicity's sake when defining Bolzano's arguments?

### Category: phenomenology
Question: What is Heidegger's view on the nature of our scientific theories?
Answer:Heidegger suggests that our scientific theories are historical artifacts that we use in technological practice, rather than systems of ideal truth.
### Category: logic-higher-order
Question: What does first order logic over the cumulative hierarchy of sets correspond to in terms of higher order logic over an individual level of the hierarchy?
Answer:First order logic over the cumulative hierarchy of sets corresponds to a very high order logic over any individual level of the hierarchy in the sense that it covers higher order logic over any \(V_α\).
### Category: microbiology
Question: Have oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equations ever been achieved in an organismal model system without significant alterations to the basic variables?
Answer:No, oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equations have not been achieved in an organismal model system without significant alterations to the basic variables until very recently, as shown in an experimental model consisting of unicellular algae and a microscopic metazoan predator (Blasius et al.  2020).
### Category: chimeras
Question: How does the text differentiate between two types of dignity and what is the relation between them?
Answer:The text differentiates between two types of dignity as "rarefied" human dignity, which is an "unconditioned and incomparable worth," and common dignity, which is manifested by someone who responds to difficult circumstances in a dignified manner. According to the text, these two concepts are distinct and while someone can be stripped of their common dignity by being placed in degrading circumstances, such treatment would only violate, not eliminate or diminish, human dignity in the rarefied sense. The text suggests that human dignity in the rarefied sense often serves as an explanation of what is problematic about eliminating common dignity.
### Category: reasoning-moral
Question: What is the principle that Henry Sidgwick introduced as crucial for resolving conflicts between distinct moral or practical considerations?
Answer:The principle of superior validity is the principle that Henry Sidgwick introduced as crucial for resolving conflicts between distinct moral or practical considerations. It is the principle that conflict between distinct moral or practical considerations can be rationally resolved only on the basis of some third principle or consideration that is both more general and more firmly warranted than the two initial competitors.
### Category: plato-utopia
Question: What is the location of the majority of people, according to Plato's Allegory of the Cave?
Answer:In Plato's Allegory of the Cave, the majority of people reside within the Cave, symbolizing their limited understanding of reality.
### Category: fictionalism-mathematics
Question: What is the main idea of the multiple-reductions argument against platonism in mathematics, specifically arithmetic?
Answer:The multiple-reductions argument against platonism in mathematics, specifically arithmetic, asserts that if there are any sequences of abstract objects that satisfy our arithmetical theories, then there are infinitely many; there is nothing that makes any of these sequences stand out as the sequence of natural numbers, but platonism is committed to the thesis that there is a unique sequence of abstract objects that is the natural numbers; hence platonism is false.
### Category: idiolects
Question: What does H's prior theory refer to in the context of interpreting S's utterance?
Answer:H's prior theory refers to how H is prepared in advance to interpret the expressions in S's utterance before it occurs.
### Category: william-auvergne
Question: Why does William need to divide the intellect into active and passive parts, according to the text?
Answer:The text suggests that William needs to divide the intellect into active and passive parts because it is impossible for the same thing to be both active and passive in the same respect. By treating the intellect as indivisible, it appears that he is committed to its being both active and passive in the same respect in the formation and reception of intelligible forms. This is a distinction that William has previously criticized, making it necessary for him to make this division in order to maintain internal consistency in his account of the intellect's generation of intelligible forms.
### Category: nominalism-mathematics
Question: How does the mathematical fictionalist propose to express the conservativeness of mathematics without moving to the metalanguage?
Answer:The mathematical fictionalist proposes to express the conservativeness of mathematics in the object-language by introducing a primitive notion of logical consistency (◊A) and using a schema that relates the axioms of a mathematical theory (M1, …, Mn) to sentences (B) that have been restricted to non-mathematical entities (B*).
### Category: formal-epistemology
Question: What is the full form of NEC in the context of the given logic system and what does it signify?
Answer:In the given logic system, NEC stands for 'necessary' and it signifies epistemic necessity, which means that only logical truths will be subject to this rule, and these are known or they follow from what is known, because they follow given no assumptions at all.
### Category: qm-consistent-histories

Answer:Paul Feyerabend was a philosopher of science known for his concept of incommensurability of scientific theories.
### Category: schiller
Question: How does Schiller describe the effect of beauty on our will and its potential for knowledge and morality?
Answer:Schiller argues that beauty creates a state of equilibrium that puts the will in a position of maximum power and self-determination, making it "the most fruitful of all in respect of knowledge and morality." By not committing to form or matter, beauty contains maximum potential for both knowledge and morality. This aesthetic state allows us to freely choose between different options, and genuine works of art can help us approach this ideal state. Schiller describes this as the "gift of humanity itself," with beauty serving as our "second creatress." However, our status as finite creatures means that this state will remain an ideal that art must continually strive to approach
### Category: homosexuality
Question: What is one criticism against queer theory by those who advocate for gay liberation as radical social change?
Answer:One criticism is that queer theory's inclusivity and lack of specificity in terms of sexual status or gender object choice may rob gays and lesbians of their distinctiveness and marginalization, desexualizing identity when the issue is about sexual identity. Additionally, it may struggle to make crucial distinctions, such as excluding transgenerational sex or setting boundaries for acceptable sado-masochism and fetishism.
### Category: early-modern-india
Question: Why might the Vaiśeṣikas argue that there cannot be an infinite number of constituent parts in an object?
Answer:The Vaiśeṣikas might argue that if an object had an infinite number of constituent parts, then it would have the same size as any other object with an infinite number of parts, such as Mount Meru and a mustard seed. This is because the size of an object is a function of the size, number, and spatial arrangement of its parts. Therefore, if there were an infinite number of parts, their size would also be infinite, leading to the counterintuitive conclusion that objects with an infinite number of parts would have the same size.
### Category: religious-pluralism
Question: Can you provide examples of significant differences in beliefs that exist among followers of major monotheistic religions regarding the nature of God and moral principles?
Answer:Certainly! For example, within Christianity, there are differing beliefs about God's nature, with some seeing God as all-controlling, while others view God as self-limiting or incapable of unilaterally controlling any aspect of reality. There is also disagreement on God's knowledge, with some believers asserting that God has infallible knowledge only of all that has occurred or is occurring, while others claim God has knowledge of all that will actually occur, and those who believe in middle knowledge argue that God knows all that would actually occur in any possible context.

In terms of moral principles, there is disagreement on whether moral principles stipulated by God for correct human behavior flow from God’s nature or character, determining God’s behavior, or if God acts in accordance with a different set of moral rules than those given to humans. Furthermore, there are varying beliefs about who will spend eternity in God’s presence, with some believing only those who have consciously “given their lives to Christ” will be saved, while others believe many who have never even heard the name of Jesus will enter God’s presence, and yet others do not even believe in subjective immortality (a conscious afterlife).

Similar differences in beliefs can be found in other monotheistic religions, such as Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism. For instance, Muslims differ significantly among themselves on issues like the autonomy of the individual when interpreting their religious texts, how best to apply core values to modern life, and the status of women.
### Category: skepticism-latin-america
Question: Who is José Raimundo Maia Neto and what is his main contribution to the history of skepticism?
Answer:José Raimundo Maia Neto is a Brazilian philosopher who has made significant contributions to the history of skepticism. His main contribution is his argument that Academic skepticism played a more important role in modern skepticism than what is recognized in Popkin's interpretation. Maia Neto has written numerous papers on various philosophers such as Montaigne, Pierre Charron, Descartes, Gassendi, Pierre-Daniel Huet, Pascal, Bayle, and Hume to defend his interpretation.

### Category: modality-epistemology
Question: What potential issue does Williamson's method of counterfactual evaluation face according to Boghossian, Tahko, and Roca-Royes?
Answer:Williamson's method of counterfactual evaluation potentially faces the issue of circularity in his epistemology of modality, as it may rely on pre-existing knowledge of constitutive facts regarding the essence of objects, which are understood to be modal in nature (Boghossian 2011; Tahko 2012; Roca-Royes 2011b)
### Category: preferences
Question: What is one limitation of numerically representing preferences?
Answer:One limitation of numerically representing preferences is that not all preferences can be represented numerically.
### Category: voting-methods
Question: In the scenario described, how many votes did candidate C win the election with when two voters from the first group did not show up?
Answer:It is not possible to determine the exact number of votes candidate C won the election with based on the information provided. If two voters from the first group did not show up, and assuming they would have voted for their top-ranked candidate as in previous rounds, then candidate C would have won with at least 5 votes (since C received 3 votes from the second group and at least 2 from the first group). However, the exact number depends on how the rest of the voters in the first group cast their votes in this new scenario.
### Category: aristotle-aesthetics
Question: What could be the different interpretations of "a certain katharsis" (tina katharsin) in Aristotle's discussion of tragedy?
Answer:Aristotle's use of "a certain katharsis" (tina katharsin) in his discussion of tragedy could mean that all people, including both the pathetikoi and any other spectators, undergo the same sort of medical katharsis. Alternatively, it could indicate that each group undergoes a different sort of katharsis.
### Category: compositionality
Question: What is the principle that states that the meaning of a complex expression is fully determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents?
Answer:The principle of compositionality is the idea that once we fix what the parts of a complex expression mean and how they are put together, we have no more leeway regarding the meaning of the whole; it is a fundamental presupposition of most contemporary work in semantics.
### Category: basing-epistemic
Question: How does Paul K. Moser describe the way a belief is nondeviantly sustained by a reason according to his account?
Answer:According to Moser's account, a belief is nondeviantly sustained by a reason when it is causally sustained in a nondeviant manner by both the believing of or assenting to Q (a proposition) and by the association of P and Q (two propositions where P supports Q).
### Category: category-theory
Question: How has categorical logic demonstrated its flexibility and connections to other fields of mathematics?
Answer:Categorical logic has shown its flexibility by modeling many surprising results of constructive and intuitionistic mathematics in a proper categorical setting, and by providing natural generalizations of standard set-theoretic notions from twentieth century logic, such as Tarski’s semantics, which have established links to various areas of mathematics.
### Category: implicit-bias

Answer:The earliest philosophers that argued for the identity thesis according to the text were Humphreys in 1995 and Hughes in 1999.
### Category: equal-opportunity
Question: Why must the justification of a candidate conception of equality of opportunity be sought in the context of the full theory of justice it is a part of?
Answer:The justification of a candidate conception of equality of opportunity must be sought in the context of the full theory of justice it is a part of because formal and substantive equality of opportunity norms are proposed as components of a moral theory of justified social inequality. By examining how the component would function in the overall theory and how well the theory with that component in place would perform, we can evaluate its justification. This is analogous to examining a component of a car, such as a carburetor design, by seeing how it would function in the car and how well the car with that component in place would perform.
### Category: computability
Question: What class of problems can be solved by a non-deterministic machine that uses polynomial time, including reusing space for successive branches of the computation, and accepts if any branch leads to acceptance?
Answer:\(\NP\) is contained in \(\PSPACE\) because in \(\PSPACE\) we can systematically try every single branch of an \(\NP\) computation, reusing space for the successive branches, and accepting if any of these branches lead to acceptance.
### Category: wesley-salmon
Question: What is the role of assumptions introduced as hypotheses at the discovery level in relation to the symmetry condition?
Answer:The assumptions introduced as hypotheses at the discovery level serve as a wager that is tested in the context of justification. The symmetry condition thus represents this wager, which is made in the context of discovery and evaluated in the context of justification

### Category: scientific-realism
Question: What is one way in which realists have tried to explain approximate truth of theories in qualitative terms?
Answer:One way in which realists have attempted to explicate approximate truth in qualitative terms is through the concept of limiting cases. According to this view, a theory may be considered more approximately true than one that preceded it if the earlier theory can be described as a limiting case of the later one. This means that as certain conditions change, the later theory becomes equivalent to the earlier one in some domains. The realist can then argue that later theories offer more approximately true descriptions of the relevant subject matter, and that this can be illuminated in part by studying how they build on the limiting cases represented by their predecessors.
### Category: lawphil-naturalism
Question: What is the view of the Replacement Naturalist regarding the need for naturalizing theory of adjudication when legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of legal outcomes?
Answer:The Replacement Naturalist might take the view that there is no reason to call for naturalizing theory of adjudication in the range of cases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of legal outcomes (i.e., precisely those cases where the foundationalist program can be carried out).
### Category: moral-character
Question: In what ways do Marx and Mill's views of character align with Aristotle's perspective?
Answer:Marx and Mill's views of character align with Aristotle's perspective in their acceptance of the importance of self-esteem and self-confidence arising from the expression of rational powers unique to human beings. They also agree that socio-political structures significantly impact the production and preservation of this kind of self-esteem, with Marx focusing on democratic workplaces, Mill on political and familial equality, and Aristotle on a specific type of political community.
### Category: civic-education
Question: Who is considered one of the founders of the public-school system in the United States, despite living in an era before public schools were established?
Answer:Noah Webster is considered one of the founders of the public-school system in the United States, due to his efforts in promoting universal education and creating his own speller and dictionary to advance a common American language.
### Category: justification-public
Question: What is the characteristic of intelligible reasons that makes them go beyond mere logical sufficiency in justifying something?
Answer:Intelligible reasons must be available to others to consider as reasons for the agent, which gives them epistemic credentials beyond mere logical sufficiency in justifying something.
### Category: buddhism-chan
Question: What is the objection raised about the view of reality as self-generating and without a specific point of origin, and how does it relate to the concept of karma?
Answer:The objection is that if reality is self-generating, and humans are relational and intergenerational beings with karmically-conditioned experience, then it seems there would be an infinite burden of karma to bear and work through, making enlightenment or liberation from conflict, trouble, and suffering impossible. This is because if there has been an infinite amount of time for acting with ill intent or in accordance with misguided values, there would also be an infinite amount of troubling experiential consequences to work through.
### Category: natural-law-theories
Question: What kind of reasons will have a decisive place in concept-formation in social science including descriptive general theory of law if moral reason is nothing more than practical reason at full stretch?
Answer:If moral reason is nothing more than practical reason at full stretch, fully critical and adequate as reason, then moral reasons will have a decisive place in concept-formation in social science including descriptive general theory of law.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What is the name given to the maximum c.e. \(m\)-degree?
Answer:The maximum c.e. \(m\)-degree is called \(\textrm{deg}_m(K) =_{\textrm{df}} \mathbf{0}'_m\).
### Category: social-ontology
Question: How do Tuomela and Miller differ from Searle in their account of group intention?
Answer:Tuomela and Miller propose that there is an overlooked class of attitudes that individual people possess called "we-attitudes," which they believe are built out of more standard attitudes. In contrast, Searle considers these we-attitudes to be distinct primitive mental states, similar to a summative view of group attitudes but with collective attitudes being sums of we-attitudes rather than I-attitudes.
### Category: normativity-metaethics
Question: What kind of concern might there be about normative fundamentalism, in addition to the lack of explanation for what makes base-facts normative?
Answer:In addition to the lack of explanation for what makes base-facts (such as reasons, values, or fittingness) normative, there might also be a concern about the existence of (putative) base-facts that do not seem robustly normative. This would trigger a need for a non-question-begging explanation of the difference between robust and non-robust (putative) base-facts, which might or might not be attainable.
### Category: skepticism-content-externalism
Question: What does Brueckner mean when he refers to the "Putnamian non-disquotational truth conditions"?
Answer:When Brueckner refers to "Putnamian non-disquotational truth conditions", he is referring to the idea that the truth of the statement "I am a BIV" cannot be determined simply by looking at the statement itself, but rather depends on some external factors that are not explicitly mentioned in the statement. These truth conditions are called "non-disquotational" because they cannot be captured by simply quoting the statement in question in the metalanguage. Instead, the metalanguage must contain some additional information about the context in which the statement is made, such as the possibility that the speaker is a brain in a vat (BIV).
### Category: proof-theory
Question: What property does a normal proof \(\cD\) satisfy with respect to its subformulas according to Corollary 2.2?
Answer:According to Corollary 2.2, every formula in \(\cD\) is either a subformula of an element of \(\Gamma\) or of A in a normal proof \(\cD\) of A from \(\Gamma\).
### Category: scientific-objectivity
Question: How has statistician Ronald A. Fisher criticized the idea of measuring scientific evidence in terms of subjective probability?
Answer:Ronald A. Fisher has argued that measuring psychological tendencies cannot be relevant for scientific inquiry and sustain claims to objectivity. He has challenged how scientific objectivity can square with subjective degree of belief.
### Category: logic-games
Question: What does it mean when Duplicator has a winning strategy in the pebble game described, where players can only use p numbered pebbles and must reuse them after they run out?
Answer:It means that the two structures being compared agree for sentences which use at most p variables, regardless of how many times those variables occur.
### Category: suarez
Question: Why was the nature of final causation, or causation by an end, relatively unknown to ancient philosophers?
Answer:The nature of final causation was relatively unknown to ancient philosophers because it is more obscure than other types of causation and was not inquired into as thoroughly as other types of causes. Additionally, final causation is often considered to be more eminent or important than other causes, so it is crucial to understand what it is and how it operates.
### Category: collective-intentionality
Question: What are the three components of intentional attitudes that have been suggested as the locus of collectivity in collective intentionality?
Answer:The three components of intentional attitudes that have been suggested as the locus of collectivity in collective intentionality are content, mode, and subject. Content-accounts claim that collective intentionality requires a collective content, mode-accounts insist on a collective mode of intending, while subject-accounts hold that the element of collectivity is in the subject which forms a unified group.
### Category: burke
Question: How did Burke's political thought benefit from his philosophical understanding and combination of ideas?

### Category: fictional-entities
Question: What is one possible consequence of understanding neo-Meinongian objects as correlates of sets of properties instead of sets of properties themselves?
Answer:If understanding neo-Meinongian objects as correlates of sets of properties implies that the activity of fiction making is essential to the identity of fictional objects, then this would be closer to a 'creationist' view rather than pure neo-Meinongianism.
### Category: friedrich-hayek
Question: What does Hayek mean when he describes the valuation process as subjective, and how does this differ from it being a matter of opinion?
Answer:When Hayek describes the valuation process as subjective, he means that it is a process of perceiving reality as needing one response rather than another. This differs from it being a matter of opinion because subjective valuation is based on an individual's assessment of tradeoffs in response to reality, whereas opinions can be arbitrary or unfounded. In other words, subjective valuation is grounded in an individual's perception of reality, while opinions can be detached from it.
### Category: consciousness-animal
Question: What is the consequence of rejecting epiphenomenalism with respect to the possibility of knowing if a member of another taxonomic group has conscious states?
Answer:If one rejects epiphenomenalism and maintains that consciousness does have effects on behavior, then a strategy of inference to the best explanation may be used to support the attribution of consciousness to other taxonomic groups. This implies that it is possible to know that a member of another taxonomic group has conscious states, even if some specific features of their conscious experience remain out of reach for humans to fully grasp.
### Category: facts
Question: What is the principle that states that everything must have a reason or cause?
Answer:The principle of sufficient reason is the principle that states that everything must have a reason or cause.
### Category: providence-divine
Question: What does the Boethian God risk even if he is timeless and omniscient according to the article?
Answer:Even if the Boethian God is timeless and omniscient, he still runs significant risks in creating the world because his knowledge of creatures' actions is ontologically posterior to their activities, making it impossible for his creative will to be guided by his knowledge of their actions. He can only hope that creatures will use their freedom justly and wisely, with some allowance for the possibility that they will not, but otherwise simply trusting in the outcome.
### Category: ehrenfels

### Category: political-obligation
Question: What is Massimo Renzo's response to the challenge of unjust associations when it comes to associative political obligations?
Answer:Massimo Renzo sketches a response that focuses on what makes a person a member of a political society through a "quasi-voluntarist reformulation of the associative model." According to this view, we voluntarily occupy our roles even in families and polities as long as we could have stepped out of them if we had wanted. Therefore, oppressed "members" of a polity have no associative obligations, at least if stepping out of their role as "members" is not an option available to them at a reasonable cost.
### Category: logic-nonmonotonic
Question: What is a term used to describe a conclusion derived from two conflicting arguments in logic?
Answer:A conclusion that is derivable via two conflicting arguments is called a Floating Conclusion in logic.
### Category: logic-temporal
Question: Can you provide an example of an inference to the best explanation?
Answer:Certainly! One classic example is that of a detective who infers that a certain person committed a crime because that explanation best fits all of the available evidence. This is an inference to the best explanation because the detective is weighing various possible explanations and selecting the one that is most likely to be true based on the evidence at hand.
### Category: future-contingents
Question: Why might some philosophers find the Leibnizian theory more intuitive than the Ockhamistic theory in certain cases?
Answer:Some philosophers might find the Leibnizian theory more intuitive than the Ockhamistic theory in certain cases because it deems some intricate propositions that are intuitively invalid as valid, whereas the Ockhamistic theory does not.
### Category: pseudo-science

### Category: kilvington
Question: What are the two kinds of limits that Kilvington used for continuous sequences in his mathematical theory?
Answer:Kilvington used two kinds of limits for continuous sequences in his mathematical theory: intrinsic boundaries (when an element is a member of the sequence of the elements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod sic) and extrinsic boundaries (when an element which serves as a boundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds: maximum quod non, minimum quod non).
### Category: other-minds
Question: What two capacities must be exercised in order to have a thought about an object to the effect that it has a certain property, according to Evans?

### Category: contractualism
Question: Imagine that Z decides not to disarm the mine, leading to one worker being seriously injured. How could one justify this decision using utilitarianism, even though it results in a worse outcome for one person?
Answer:Utilitarianism is the belief that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. In this case, Z's decision could be justified by arguing that preventing ten times worse harm (one worker being seriously injured) outweighs the harm caused by Z getting pneumonia. This would ultimately result in greater overall utility or well-being since only one person suffers from pneumonia compared to one person suffering from a severe injury.
### Category: democracy
Question: How does Rawls justify civil disobedience in a nearly just society?
Answer:Rawls argues that while citizens of a "nearly just" society have a pro tanto duty to obey its laws in virtue of it being nearly just, civil disobedience can be justified as a way of making the relevant society more just.
### Category: philosophy-mexico
Question: What is one distinguishing feature of Mexican philosophy?

### Category: touch
Question: How does the temperature of our bodies affect how we perceive the temperature of neutral water?
Answer:The temperature of our bodies can affect how we perceive the temperature of neutral water. If our bodies are already heated, a warm stimuli will feel cold, but if our bodies are in a cold state, the same warm stimuli will feel hot. This can be experienced simultaneously by heating one hand in hot water and cooling another in an ice bath, and then exposing them both to a neutral water bath. The hand that was in the hot water will feel the neutral water as cold, while the hand that was in the ice bath will feel the neutral water as hot.
### Category: ethics-belief
Question: Why do some philosophers consider epistemic norms to be categorical rather than instrumental imperatives?
Answer:Some philosophers regard epistemic norms as categorical rather than instrumental imperatives because they believe that these norms are set for us by our nature as morally engaged, knowledge-seeking beings, rather than by a contingent act of will. As a result, they see these norms as necessary rather than hypothetical, and thus as requiring belief in certain ways as a matter of natural or moral necessity.
### Category: publichealth-ethics
Question: What is the harm principle and why is it considered a compelling justification for public health policies that interfere with individual liberty?
Answer:The harm principle is a political and ethical principle which states that the only justification for restricting someone's liberty is to prevent harm to others. It is considered a compelling justification for public health policies that interfere with individual liberty because it helps to strike a balance between protecting individual rights and promoting the common good. This principle is often invoked to justify various infectious disease control interventions and was used to justify the banning of smoking in public places in the United States once the public became persuaded of the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. However, policies that interfere with conduct that does not produce direct harm to others can be criticized as government overreach if they fail to satisfy this principle.
### Category: alexander-crummell

### Category: ibn-sina-metaphysics
Question: How does Avicenna connect the celestial spheres to intelligences in his philosophical system?
Answer:In Avicenna's philosophical system, he connects the celestial spheres to intelligences by positing that each sphere is bound to a specific intelligence after the First (Ilāhiyyāt, IX, 3, 401, 9–12). This includes the outermost orb, the orb of the fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, with the earth at the center. Theology, metaphysics, cosmology, and noetic seem to be fused in this system.
### Category: type-theory-church

### Category: consciousness
Question: How can explanatory gaps be seen as supporting physicalism rather than contradicting it?
Answer:Explanatory gaps can be seen as supporting physicalism if one assumes that human agents are physically realized cognitive systems with inherent limits that arise from their evolutionary origins and situated contextual mode of understanding. These limits would naturally result in explanatory gaps, but they would not contradict physicalism; rather, they would confirm it.
### Category: reasoning-defeasible
Question: What is the definition of a directional semantics in the context of argument systems?

### Category: real-essence
Question: What does Locke argue about our ability to know if a quality or idea has a necessary connection with a real essence that we cannot conceive?
Answer:Locke argues that it is impossible for us to know if a quality or idea has a necessary connection with a real essence that we cannot conceive, regardless of what species that real essence may be imagined to constitute.
### Category: moral-particularism-generalism
Question: What consequence does Berker argue that particularists face if they abandon noncombinatorialism about reasons?
Answer:Berker argues that if particularists abandon noncombinatorialism about reasons, they would be committed to the truth of numerous exceptionless principles, which would compromise their particularism. This is because noncombinatorialism is a commitment that particularists typically hold, which asserts that the combinatorial function for reasons cannot be finitely expressed.
### Category: mersenne
Question: How did Mersenne initially categorize metaphysics in relation to other theoretical sciences?
Answer:Mersenne initially categorized metaphysics as closer to physics because both aim to consider things as they are in themselves, rather than as they appear to our senses. This is in contrast to mathematics, which deals with abstracted objects.
### Category: realism-sem-challenge
Question: What is the Representation Problem attempting to explain according to Putnam's Model-Theoretic Argument?

### Category: providence-divine
Question: What philosophical viewpoint might best represent the religious tradition's emphasis on the mystery of why God allows evil?
Answer:The combination of skeptical theism and the Moore Switch might best represent the religious tradition's emphasis on the mystery of why God allows evil, as it involves an openness to accepting that some things remain unknown and unknowable to humans regarding God's plans and actions.
### Category: idiolects
Question: What does Lewis call the ideal situation of a language's being used according to its conventions, including implicit knowledge of L by its speakers?
Answer:Lewis calls the situation of a language’s being realized in this way a “perfect case of normal language use”. It is an idealization that assumes members of P know how L works and use it while abiding by the conventions of truthfulness and trust.
### Category: imprecise-probabilities
Question: How does Joyce use the Principal Principle (PP) to justify a preference for betting on a fair coin over an unknown bias coin with the same subjective probabilities?
Answer:Joyce argues that there is a difference between these beliefs that is worth representing, and the Principal Principle (PP) can be used to capture this difference. In the first case, where the coin is known to be fair, \(P(H)\) is represented as \(\{0.5\}\). In contrast, in the second case, where the coin's bias is unknown, \(P(H)\) is captured by \([0,1]\). This difference in representation reflects the preference for betting on the fair coin when faced with a choice between the two.
### Category: critical-theory
Question: How does Dewey suggest that we should view social facts in order to avoid turning problematic situations into empirical-normative dilemmas?
Answer:Dewey suggests that we should see social facts practically, as serving to delimit a problem in a way that affords indication and test of proposed solutions, and interacting with our understanding of the ideals that guide the practices in which such problems emerge. This way, neither fact nor ideal is fixed and neither is given justificatory or theoretical priority.
### Category: skepticism-medieval
Question: How does the text evaluate the level of interest in skeptical problems between Siger and Henry of Ghent?

He had to defend himself against the charge of being a philosopher due to the hostile climate towards philosophy during that time period.
### Category: friendship
Question: Why is there a lack of discussion in philosophy literature about the conditions under which a friendship can be properly dissolved?
Answer:Philosophy literature has not given much attention to understanding when it is proper to break off a friendship or allow it to lapse, which may be due to the complexity of defining these conditions while taking into account the commitment and intimacy inherent in friendships.
### Category: ramsey
Question: How does Ramsey describe the cognitive attitude expressed by general beliefs?

### Category: consequentializing
Question: What is the goal of notational consequentializing in demonstrating the consequentialist/non-consequentialist distinction to be unimportant?
Answer:The goal of notational consequentializing is to establish that in every instance, the target non-consequentialist theory and the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory are mere notational variants of each other. This would mean that there is nothing uniquely compelling about act-consequentialism, and no non-pragmatic reason for us to consequentialize rather than Kantianize or adopt any other normative theory.
### Category: kant
Question: How does Kant distinguish between theoretical knowledge and morally justified belief with regards to freedom?
Answer:According to Kant, we do not have theoretical knowledge that we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible experience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free in this sense. He also claims that we have practical knowledge of the reality of freedom, based on the moral law, which is unshakeable and provides support for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality of the soul.

### Category: monism
Question: How might an existence pluralist argue against Occam's Razor in order to deny premise 6 of the exclusion argument?
Answer:A possible approach for an existence pluralist would be to argue that Occam's Razor should be modified to consider the notion of basicness. The idea is that there is little issue in multiplying derivative entities, and what seems problematic is the multiplication of basic entities. This modified version of Occam's Razor is sometimes referred to as "the ontological free lunch."

### Category: benjamin
Question: What is the relationship between Romantic aesthetics and history in Benjamin's work, as revealed through the concept of art criticism?
Answer:The concept of art criticism in Romantic aesthetics rests upon epistemological presuppositions that reveal the 'messianic' essence of Romanticism. This essence is characterized by the conjunction between the highest metaphysical state of history and the ephemerality of each particular moment, which theoretically determines the Romantic relationship between the artistic Absolute (the Idea of art) and each particular artwork, as per Benjamin's insights in his doctoral dissertation on Early German Romantics' philosophy of art, despite his initial plan to focus on Kant's philosophy of history.
### Category: civil-disobedience
Question: How does Emanuela Ceva characterize conscientious objection?
Answer:Emanuela Ceva characterizes conscientious objection as a form of political participation.
### Category: consciousness-temporal
Question: What is the phenomenon that occurs when still images are shown at a rapid pace, creating the illusion of clear motion?
Answer:The phenomenon is known as 'illusory motion' or 'the phi phenomenon'. It refers to how still images can give rise to the experience of motion when displayed quickly in succession, as in cinema film.
### Category: propositions
Question: Why might it be considered peculiar to use certain phrases such as "my believing what you desire" or "my dreading what the thermometer indicated"?
Answer:The peculiarity of these phrases arises due to the fact that attitudes and their objects must match in their type of content. For instance, personal attitudes such as beliefs, doubts, and assertions typically align with propositional content (e.g., what someone contemplates or entertains), while impersonal attitudes such as fear or hope correspond to nonpropositional content (e.g., what someone desires or what the thermometer indicates). The mismatch between personal attitudes and nonpropositional objects (or impersonal attitudes with propositional objects) results in linguistic puzzles that need explaining.
### Category: femapproach-continental
Question: What is the aim of the transContinental turn in Continental feminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole?
Answer:The aim of the transContinental turn in Continental feminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole is to incorporate a global view of feminist issues and theories, thereby addressing the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of continental philosophy.
### Category: simon-faversham
Question: What is the purpose of Simon's twofold account of individuation?
Answer:The purpose of Simon's twofold account of individuation is to provide an alternative to the Averroistic solution for the individuation of immaterial beings, such as celestial bodies, intelligences, and the human intellect, without resorting to spiritual matter. Instead, he proposes individuation by subsistence to account for these entities, while maintaining individuation by quantitative division of matter for material beings.
### Category: probability-interpret
Question: What is the condition for an ethically neutral proposition to have a probability of 1/2 for a given agent?
Answer:An ethically neutral proposition \(N\) has a probability of 1/2 for a given agent if and only if the agent is indifferent between the gambles where they prefer \(A\) to \(B\) and where \(N\) is true leads to \(A\) with a probability of 1/2, and \(N\) is false leads to \(B\) with a probability of 1/2, and where \(N\) is true leads to \(B\) with a probability of 1/2, and \(N\) is false leads to \(A\) with a probability of 1/2.
### Category: content-teleological
Question: What is Burge's criticism of standard teleosemantics, according to which type of organisms does he argue teleosemantic theories attribute representational states without explanatory value?
Answer:Burge criticizes standard teleosemantics for being too liberal in attributing representational states to simple organisms such as plants, protists, and bacteria, where he argues such attributions have no explanatory value.
### Category: aquinas-moral-political
Question: Does Aquinas consider political community to be as important as marriage and family according to his interpretation of Aristotle's axiom?
Answer:No, according to Aquinas, political community is not as important as marriage and family. He interprets Aristotle's axiom as asserting our social nature and our need for interpersonal relationships for various necessities. However, he thinks that human beings have a stronger inclination towards marriage and family than political community. Additionally, Aquinas believes that political communities have been relativized by the Church as a complete community.
### Category: russell-moral
Question: Who is credited with first raising a broadly logical objection to emotivism, which was later refined by P.T. Geach?
Answer:W.D. Ross is credited with first raising a broadly logical objection to emotivism, which was later refined by P.T. Geach.
### Category: meaning-holism
Question: What happened to the causal theories of meaning inspired by Kripke and Putnam that initially seemed like candidates for an atomistic semantics?
Answer:The causal theories of meaning inspired by Kripke and Putnam initially seemed like candidates for an atomistic semantics, but they quickly ran aground on various counterexamples, such as the discussion of “Madagascar”. As a result, the view slid increasingly towards something that was at least molecularist in structure, requiring some beliefs about sortals since the objects we would encounter at any “baptism” could be counted as instances of any number of kinds.
### Category: disjunction
Question: How is negation typically interpreted in formal systems?
Answer:In formal systems, negation is typically interpreted as the denial or contradiction of a statement or proposition.
### Category: moral-sentimentalism
Question: What is the core claim of expressivism about the sentence "Murder is wrong", according to Mark Schroeder?
Answer:The core claim of expressivism about the sentence "Murder is wrong", according to Mark Schroeder, is that it is related to disapproval of murder in just the same way as the sentence "The sun is shining" is related to the belief that the sun is shining, with the only difference being that the expressed state is non-descriptive.
### Category: law-language
Question: What is the 'container-retrieval' theory in legal philosophy, as described by Pierluigi Chiassoni?
Answer:The 'container-retrieval' theory in legal philosophy is the idea that legislative language is filled with content by linguistic conventions as to the application of the words in which it is expressed. According to this theory, the task of applying legislation is to identify those cases to which its words conventionally apply. This means that if English speakers were disposed in 1951 to apply the word 'vehicle' to a chicken coop on wheels, then Garner v Burr was rightly decided. If they were disposed to withhold the term, the case was wrongly decided. And if they had no shared disposition either way, then there was a gap in the law, and the Court of Appeal had to fill it. The content-retrieval theorist is doomed to conclude that competent lawyers cannot disagree in good faith as to what law has been made.
### Category: propositions-singular
Question: What type of proposition could be considered if we want to examine the relationship between language and reality?
Answer:A proposition that considers the relationship between language and reality is known as a semantic proposition. Semantics is the study of how words and symbols represent concepts and objects in reality, and how they convey meaning in language.
### Category: ethics-deontological
Question: How does Nagel reconcile consequentialism and deontology in his theory?
Answer:Nagel reconciles consequentialism and deontology by allocating agent-neutral reasons of consequentialism to our "objective" viewpoint and the agent-relative reasons of deontology as part of our inherent subjectivity. However, his allocations are non-exclusive, meaning that the same situation can be seen from either subjective or objective viewpoints, making it unclear how they can be combined into an overall view.
### Category: sovereignty
Question: Who did Thomas Hobbes consider as the sovereign entity that reigned supreme and was above the law?
Answer:Thomas Hobbes considered the Leviathan as the sovereign entity that reigned supreme and was above the law. The Leviathan represented the abstract notion of the state and was established by the people through a contract in which they transferred all of their rights.
### Category: kant-spacetime
Question: What is Kant's definition of an "exposition" according to the provided text?
Answer:An "exposition" is a clear representation of what belongs to a concept, and it is considered metaphysical if it contains what the concept presents as a priori given. It is different from a definition and focuses primarily on our representation of a concept rather than the concept itself.
### Category: william-david-ross
Question: What must be done in order to determine which act we ought to do when faced with multiple options according to Ross's theory of prima facie duty?
Answer:In order to determine which act we ought to do when faced with multiple options according to Ross's theory of prima facie duty, we must examine all the acts open to us and determine all the ways in which they are prima facie right and all the ways in which they are prima facie wrong. We then figure out the balance of prima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness or vice versa in each case. The act with the greatest balance of overall prima facie rightness is the one we ought all things considered to do and what we ought all things considered to do is our duty proper.
### Category: logical-form
Question: What must be the antecedent of 'himself' in the sentence 'Pat thinks Chris treated himself/him'?
Answer:In the sentence 'Pat thinks Chris treated himself/him', the antecedent of 'himself' must be the subject of 'treated', which is 'Chris'.
### Category: evil-kinds-origins
Question: Why might philosophers of religion in the broadly Continental tradition be more likely to discuss the nature of evil as opposed to the problem it raises for theism?
Answer:Philosophers of religion in the broadly Continental tradition may be more likely to discuss the nature of evil as opposed to the problem it raises for theism because they tend to resist assimilating evil to more general or anodyne notions, and instead prefer to engage with the term as it was used historically in the discipline by influential figures such as Augustine, Aquinas, Leibniz, and Bayle. This approach allows them to explore the unique philosophical issues and complexities surrounding evil, rather than solely focusing on how it might pose challenges for theistic belief systems.
### Category: qt-epr
Question: What is another term for the principles of separability and locality as used by Einstein in his arguments about the incompleteness of quantum theory?
Answer:Einstein referred to separability and locality as "independent existence" in his arguments about the incompleteness of quantum theory.
### Category: natural-kinds
Question: What is one of the reasons given by philosophers such as Ludwig (2018) and Hacking (2007a) for eliminating the concept of natural kinds in scientific classification?
Answer:One reason given by philosophers such as Ludwig (2018) and Hacking (2007a) for eliminating the concept of natural kinds in scientific classification is that the concept is applicable to a heterogeneous set of practices of natural classification, which can be misleading to practicing scientists. They argue that the usage of the natural kind concept is so multifarious that it does not play a useful role in scientific classification, and therefore it should be eliminated.
### Category: recursive-functions
Question: What is the intended interpretation of universally quantified statements in Skolem's system, using the example of the commutative property of addition?
Answer:In Skolem's system, universally quantified statements such as the commutative property of addition are intended to hold universally for all natural numbers. This means that the statement applies to every possible value of x and y in the domain of natural numbers.
### Category: idealism
Question: How does Hume's view on knowledge relate to monism and idealism?
Answer:Hume's view on knowledge, which consists of ideas, their relations, and causation established by imagination and custom, can be seen as an epistemological ground for idealism. In some interpretations, he reduces both minds and objects to bundles of perceptions, similar to Berkeley's idealism. However, Hume does not necessarily commit to substantial minds or bodies, which distinguishes his position from Berkeley's. Additionally, Hume entertains a monistic perspective that sees minds and objects as different sets of perceptions.
### Category: ethics-belief
Question: How do philosophers differ in their understanding of evidence in an Evidentialist theory of ethics?
Answer:Philosophers have different interpretations of evidence in an Evidentialist theory of ethics, with some defining it in terms of demonstrative proof, others in terms of objective and/or subjective probability, and still others in terms of any factor that influences belief.
### Category: epistemology-visual-thinking
Question: How can sensory experience be involved in mathematical knowledge acquisition beyond a merely enabling role?
Answer:Sensory experience can play an evidential role in coming to know some mathematical facts beyond a merely enabling role (e.g., by providing reasons to believe). This challenges the traditional view of mathematics as an exclusively a priori science, suggesting that a posteriori knowledge may also be involved.
### Category: henry-ghent
Question: What is the role of the phantasm in Henry's theory of intellectual knowledge?
Answer:In Henry's theory of intellectual knowledge, the phantasm is the efficient cause of intellectual knowledge, serving as the basis for abstraction and the first operation of the intellect (simple understanding). This is a departure from Aquinas' standard doctrine, which requires a numerically distinct intelligible species as an intermediary between the phantasm and the possible intellect.
### Category: logic-conditionals
Question: How does the smoothness condition relate to condition (L) from section 3.2.1 in the context of defeasibility or nonmonotonicity?
Answer:The smoothness condition is almost identical to condition (L) from section 3.2.1, but it is used in the context of modifying the classical definition of entailment to make it compatible with defeasibility or nonmonotonicity in a model.
### Category: evolution-cultural
Question: Why do Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman argue that women must be disposed to acquire certain preferences even if they are not widely adopted in their local cultural environment?
Answer:Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman argue that women must be disposed to acquire certain preferences even if they are not widely adopted in their local cultural environment in order for cultural inheritance to overcome natural selection. This is because if women simply adopted the most widely adopted preference in their local cultural environment, cultural inheritance would not have a strong enough effect to replace undesirable traits with desirable ones in the population as a whole.
### Category: logic-intensional
Question: What significant contribution did Ruth Barcan Marcus make in the field of modal logic in 1946?
Answer:Ruth Barcan Marcus made a significant contribution in the field of modal logic in 1946 by formally extending the propositional system S2 of C. I. Lewis to include quantification, and developing it axiomatically in the style of Principia Mathematica. She also introduced the Barcan formula in its quantified form for the first time.
### Category: voting-methods
Question: What is Schwartz's Set Method and how does it determine the winners?
Answer:Schwartz's Set Method is a voting system where each voter submits a ranking of candidates, and the winners are the smallest set of candidates that would not lose in a one-on-one election against any candidate outside of that set (Schwartz 1986).
### Category: touch
Question: What is the view that temperature is not inherently "hot" or "cold," but rather that our awareness of temperature is subjective and depends on context and our body's thermal condition?
Answer:The view that temperature is not inherently "hot" or "cold," but rather that our awareness of temperature is subjective and depends on context and our body's thermal condition is known as the idea that thermal properties are secondary qualities.
### Category: molecular-biology
Question: What does Crick assert is the direction of information flow in biological systems, specifically in terms of the sequencing of bases in nucleic acid and amino acid residues in protein?
Answer:Crick asserts that information flow in biological systems is one-way, from nucleic acid to nucleic acid or from nucleic acid to protein, and is impossible in the reverse direction (protein to protein or protein to nucleic acid). He defines information as the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in protein.
### Category: justep-foundational
Question: What is the proposed source of infallibility in foundational justification if error-immunity is not found in logical relations between belief and truth?
Answer:The proposed source of infallibility in foundational justification is a special kind of justification available in support of a belief, where the belief's ground or justification entails the truth of the belief, meaning that one cannot have that justification while the belief is false.
### Category: gasset
Question: Why does Ortega argue that phenomenology, as formulated in Husserl's Ideas, is not a descriptive psychology?
Answer:Ortega argues that phenomenology is not a descriptive psychology because psychological statements are empirical and based on facts, while phenomenology is concerned with consciousness and human consciousness in a non-empirical way. He also notes that Husserl himself distinguished between the two in his later works, despite some earlier philosophers interpreting phenomenology as a form of descriptive psychology based on Husserl's earlier Logische Untersuchungen.
### Category: olivi
Question: What does Olivi argue about the organ of the sense of touch, in contrast to Aristotle's view?
Answer:Olivi argues that the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch, in contrast to Aristotle's view that the heart is the organ of the sense of touch.
### Category: consciousness-17th
Question: Why is the mind (by p7) conscious of its striving, according to this demonstration?
Answer:According to this demonstration, the mind is conscious of its striving because (by p7) it is conscious of its own affections through ideas of the body's affections (by IIp23).
### Category: nietzsche-moral-political
Question: What does Nietzsche argue is the greatest part of our spirit's activity according to The Gay Science?
Answer:According to The Gay Science, Nietzsche argues that by far the greatest part of our spirit's activity remains unconscious and unfelt.
### Category: genetic-drift
Question: What is the argument made by Hayley Clatterbuck, Elliott Sober, and Richard Lewontin regarding the relationship between genetic drift and natural selection?
Answer:Hayley Clatterbuck, Elliott Sober, and Richard Lewontin argue that it does not make sense to talk of drift dominating or being stronger than selection. They view selection and drift as population-level processes and raise concerns about how biologists have understood the value of Ns (the effective size of the population multiplied by the selection coefficient). They take a causalist stance rather than a statisticalist one, and challenge Dietrich and Millstein's claim that the nearly neutral theory is best understood as weak selection dominated by drift.
### Category: confirmation
Question: What is the relationship between the likelihood of hypotheses and the probability of evidence given those hypotheses, according to the law of likelihood?
Answer:The law of likelihood states that the likelihood of hypotheses is equal to the probability of the evidence given those hypotheses, relative to some background knowledge.
### Category: dualism
Question: What is the suggested solution for achieving unity in the mind if it is viewed as merely a bundle of properties?
Answer:The suggested solution is to postulate a primitive relation of co-consciousness in which the various mental elements stand to each other, providing a sense of unity.
### Category: qm-everett
Question: What kind of theories are the standard collapse theory and pure wave mechanics in the context of Everett's work?
Answer:The standard collapse theory is stochastic with fundamentally chance events, while pure wave mechanics is deterministic with no mention of probabilities whatsoever in the context of Everett's work.
### Category: rights-group
Question: What do proponents of group rights mean when they refer to the subjectivity of a group?
Answer:When proponents of group rights refer to the subjectivity of a group, they are talking about the feelings of strong bond and identification that individual group members have with each other. This subjectivity is seen as essential to a group's moral status and its ability to hold rights, as opposed to objective characteristics such as common history, language, or social condition.
### Category: kant-aesthetics
Question: What feeling does Kant suggest is awakened in us when we become aware of the inadequacy of our sensible faculties in estimating the magnitude of things in the world?
Answer:Kant suggests that when we become aware of the inadequacy of our sensible faculties in estimating the magnitude of things in the world, it awakens a feeling of a supersensible faculty in us.
### Category: suhrawardi
Question: Who was Mulla Sadra criticizing when he critiqued Avicennan Peripateticism?
Answer:Mulla Sadra was criticizing Avicenna's Peripateticism when he critiqued existence as a being of reason, the Platonic forms, knowledge by presence, and eschatology in Avicennan Peripateticism.
### Category: duhem
Question: How does Duhem illustrate his doctrine of natural classification and how has this led some commentators to argue that he is not an instrumentalist?
Answer:Duhem illustrates his doctrine of natural classification with an analogy of the trajectory of a ball. He argues that we cannot guess the end point of physical theory, the natural classification, by looking at any particular theory in isolation. Instead, we must appeal to the trajectory of physical theory, its history, to determine whether any particular theory is likely to contribute toward the ultimate natural classification. This approach has led some commentators to argue that Duhem's philosophy of science is more aligned with convergent or motivational realism rather than instrumentalism.
### Category: scientific-revolutions
Question: How does Milton Friedman emphasize continuity in the context of scientific revolutions?
Answer:Milton Friedman emphasizes continuity in the context of scientific revolutions by highlighting the role of philosophical ideas that defenders of new viewpoints use to establish a kind of continuity after disruptive and incommensurable changes in constitutive principles.
### Category: altruism-empirical
Question: What is the definition of preference altruism according to Clavien and Chapuisat?
Answer:Preference altruism is an action that results from preferences for improving others’ interests and welfare at some cost to oneself, regardless of the agent's ultimate desires. The agent's preference can be instrumental, generated by the belief that improving the recipient's welfare will contribute to their own pleasure or treasure.
### Category: dilthey
Question: How does re-experiencing contribute to understanding in the hermeneutical circle?
Answer:Re-experiencing contributes to understanding in the hermeneutical circle by going "forward" through the parts that give focus to the whole. It is not an actual re-construction but produces a better understanding that refines the original.
### Category: arabic-islamic-natural
Question: What were the two main questions debated among Muslim atomists concerning space?
Answer:The two main questions debated among Muslim atomists concerning space were whether space is discrete or continuous, and whether there could be unoccupied space or interstitial void spaces between atoms, or if the cosmos is a plenum.
### Category: faith
Question: How does William Alston describe the nature of faith commitment according to Jonathan Cohen's account of acceptance?
Answer:According to William Alston, faith commitment involves an active 'acceptance' rather than purely receptive belief, which can be understood as adopting a policy of deeming, positing, or postulating faith-claims as premises for decision-making, regardless of whether one feels assured of their truth. The firmness of faith commitment is then equivalent to the firmness of one's resolve to use faith-claims as a basis for thought, attitude, and behavior.
### Category: grounds-moral-status
Question: Does the presence of stronger reasons to aid one being over another always indicate a higher moral status for the being that is aided?
Answer:No, stronger reasons to aid one being over another do not necessarily indicate a higher moral status for the being that is aided. This is because FMS (the principle of sufficient moral reason) only entails that if one being has higher moral status than another, then there are stronger reasons to aid that being, but not the reverse.
### Category: physics-holism
Question: How is a state defined as being decomposable or separable across algebras associated with regions in algebraic quantum field theory?
Answer:A state is defined as being decomposable or separable across algebras associated with regions in algebraic quantum field theory if its restriction to the algebra generated by those algebras is a product state, which satisfies the condition omega(XY)=omega(X)omega(Y) for all X in one algebra and Y in the other algebra; or if it is a limit of convex combinations of product states.
### Category: boethius
Question: What is the distinction Boethius makes between two ways of being good, according to the text?
Answer:Boethius distinguishes between being good substantially, in which case 'a is not-F' is inconceivable, and being good in that it exists, in which case 'a is not-F' is impossible given the way the world is set up.
### Category: sense-data
Question: What philosophical view did Descartes and Locke hold regarding external objects and how did Berkeley and Hume attempt to challenge this view?
Answer:Descartes and Locke held a realist position regarding external objects, believing that representations mediate their perception. Berkeley and Hume sought to challenge this view by arguing that it leads to skepticism, with Berkeley adopting idealism and Hume adopting common-sense realism in response.
### Category: computational-mind
Question: What is the philosophical view that mental content is not solely determined by internal neurophysiology but also by factors outside the thinker's skin, such as causal relations to the environment?
Answer:Externalism about mental content is the philosophical view that mental content is not solely determined by internal neurophysiology but also by factors outside the thinker's skin, such as causal relations to the environment.
### Category: concept-evil
Question: Why does Nietzsche argue that we should move beyond judgments of good and evil?
Answer:Nietzsche argues that we should move beyond judgments of good and evil because they do not describe a moral reality, but are merely used to demonize enemies, promote the weak in spirit and suppress the strong, and they contribute to an unhealthy view of life which judges relief from suffering as more valuable than creative self-expression and accomplishment. He also believes that the concepts of good and evil arose from negative emotions of envy, hatred, and resentment and were created by the powerless and weak to take revenge against their oppressors.
### Category: williams-dc
Question: What is an example of a counterargument proposed by Marc Lange against Nancy Cartwright's theory of laws of nature?
Answer:Marc Lange proposes a counterexample involving the concept of "grue" to challenge Nancy Cartwright's views on laws of nature. The argument is based on the idea that if our sample of green things up to a certain point in time is not also a sample of grue things (i.e., things that are green up to that point in time but blue thereafter), then Williams' argument about laws of nature may not apply equally to both concepts, suggesting that there may be some issues with his theory.
### Category: bounded-rationality
Question: Why might some conclusions reached through rational analysis seem normatively unreasonable?
Answer:Some conclusions of rational analysis might seem normatively unreasonable due to the limitations of the analytic method, which may not always account for all relevant factors or perspectives in a given situation.
### Category: justice-distributive
Question: What does Will Kymlicka outline as the steps in Robert Nozick's argument for self-ownership?
Answer:Will Kymlicka outlines the following steps in Robert Nozick's argument for self-ownership: (1) individuals have moral property rights in their bodies, (2) these rights include the right to transfer ownership of one's body and labor to others, (3) these transactions are inviolable and do not require justification, and (4) interference with these transactions is impermissible and equivalent to slavery or forced labor.
### Category: implicature
Question: How does W. Davis (2016a) categorize methods of explaining and inferring conversational implicatures?
Answer:W. Davis (2016a) distinguishes methods of explaining and inferring speaker implicatures from those of sentence implicatures, with different methods described in separate sections of his work.
### Category: nietzsche
Question: What role does Nietzsche suggest art plays in relation to science's discovery of the general untruth and mendaciousness of human knowledge and sensation?
Answer:Nietzsche suggests that art serves as a counterforce against the honesty of recognizing the general untruth and mendaciousness of human knowledge and sensation, helping us to avoid nausea and suicide by providing a good will to appearance.
### Category: frederick-douglass
Question: What did Douglass argue was the true nature of blacks, against the claim that they were beasts?
Answer:Douglass argued that blacks were humans, not beasts, and that slavery had brutalized them.
### Category: dialetheism
Question: What is a key concept in dialectics that allows for the acceptance of certain contradictions without committing to all contradictions?
Answer:A paraconsistent logic is a key concept in dialectics that allows for the acceptance of certain contradictions without committing to all contradictions. This is because a paraconsistent logic is not explosive, meaning that a contradiction does not entail everything within such a logic.
### Category: civic-education
Question: Who did Jerome Bruner follow in his urging of educators to get their students out into the local communities to explore various aspects of life experience?
Answer:Jerome Bruner followed John Dewey in his urging of educators to get their students out into the local communities to explore various aspects of life experience.
### Category: justification-public
Question: What must reasons given in support of a principle meet according to the intelligibility requirement?
Answer:According to the intelligibility requirement, reasons given in support of a principle must meet rational standards so that others can see them as reasons for the person who offers it, at least according to that person’s standard.
### Category: feyerabend
Question: What does Feyerabend's pragmatic theory of observation focus on regarding observation-sentences?
Answer:Feyerabend's pragmatic theory of observation focuses on the causal role of observation-sentences in the production and refutation of theories rather than their having a special core of empirical meaning. This reflects his view that theory is meaningful independently of experience and that there is no principled semantic distinction between theoretical terms and observation terms.
### Category: rawls
Question: Where does Rawls locate justice in a liberal society?
Answer:Rawls locates justice in the basic structure of a liberal society, which includes the political constitution, legal system, economy, family, and other major social institutions that distribute the main benefits and burdens of social life, such as social recognition, basic rights, work opportunities, income, and wealth.
### Category: information

### Category: collins
Question: Who was the individual that Anthony Collins met in 1703, visited multiple times over the next year and a half, and corresponded with about philosophical topics?
Answer:John Locke was the individual that Anthony Collins met in 1703, visited multiple times over the next year and a half, and corresponded with about philosophical topics.
### Category: fechner
Question: What was the significant event in Fechner's life that led him to see nature as an organic whole rather than just a mechanism?
Answer:Fechner's reading of Lorenz Oken’s Lehrbuch zur Naturphilosophie in 1820 had a profound impact on him. This book introduced him to Schelling’s Naturphilosophie, which presented a systematic exposition of nature as an organic whole, thereby shifting Fechner's perspective on nature from viewing it as a mere mechanism.
### Category: causation-probabilistic
Question: Does the causal modeling framework provide a traditional philosophical reduction of causation to probabilities?
Answer:No, the causal modeling framework does not offer a traditional philosophical reduction of causation to probabilities by providing an 'if and only if' definition of causation in terms of probabilities. Instead, it provides a set of postulates about how causal structure constrains probability values.
### Category: causation-metaphysics
Question: What kind of information, in addition to the intrinsic features of the process leading from cause to effect, might be relevant for determining causality?
Answer:In addition to the intrinsic features of the process leading from cause to effect, counterfactual information about what things would have been like in the absence of the cause might also be relevant for determining causality.
### Category: vienna-circle
Question: Who were the members of the Vienna Circle, and what was their role?
Answer:The Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers and philosophically interested scientists who met regularly in the years from 1924 to 1936 to discuss problems in the philosophy of science. The long-term regulars of the group, who gained prominence through their philosophical publications, are considered its core members. The group's work is often followed into the post-Schlick era, and it had international contacts and visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of analytical philosophers of science.
### Category: quantum-field-theory
Question: What are the crucial axioms in Wightman's field axiomatics of Quantum Field Theory?
Answer:The crucial axioms in Wightman's field axiomatics of Quantum Field Theory are covariance, microcausality (spacelike separated field operators required to either commute or anticommute), and spectrum condition (positive energy in all Lorentz frames, so that the vacuum is a stable ground state).
### Category: negation
Question: What does Henry (1967) attribute Anselm's complicated observations on modal/negative interaction to?
Answer:Henry (1967) attributes Anselm's complicated observations on modal/negative interaction to the quirks of Latin usage.

### Category: feminism-gender
Question: Why does MacKinnon believe that legal restrictions on pornography are necessary to end the subordinate status of women?
Answer:MacKinnon sees legal restrictions on pornography as necessary because she believes that pornography portrays a false picture of women's desires, which in turn conditions men's sexuality so that they view women's submission as sexy. This perpetuates power inequalities between men and women by enforcing a male version of sexuality onto women, sometimes by force. MacKinnon argues that these power relations (dominance) are prior to and responsible for differences in traits, behavior, and roles between men and women, rather than the other way around.
### Category: intuitionism
Question: What happens to certain classically total functions when applied to real numbers that intuitionists cannot decide whether they are positive or not?
Answer:Such classically total functions cease to be total in an intuitionistic setting, becoming instead undefined or indeterminate for those real numbers.
### Category: mally
Question: What is the claim made by Mally regarding conceptual objects and their properties according to Zalta's interpretation?
Answer:According to Zalta's interpretation of Mally, a group of properties determines a conceptual object, which does not instantiate any of those properties but is instead characterized by their negations. For example, the conceptual object determined by the property of being triangular would be non-triangular, as it does not instantiate the property of being triangular but does instantiate the property of being non-triangular. This is because every object is complete with respect to instantiation, and the property of being a conceptual object excludes all specific properties, including shape.
### Category: bosanquet
Question: Who does thirdly Boasanquet attribute as maintaining that there is no knowledge by acquaintance?
Answer:Boasanquet maintains that it is thirdly Berkeley who asserts that there is no knowledge by acquaintance.
### Category: epistemology-virtue
Question: In what two primary ways is explanatory talk context-sensitive according to Greco's virtue contextualism?
Answer:Explanatory talk is context-sensitive in two primary ways according to Greco's virtue contextualism. First, abnormal features tend to be explanatorily salient, such as in the example of a tiger causing panic in an apartment building. Second, our interests and purposes single out certain features as especially relevant, as in the example of a teacher explaining why a student failed an exam by pointing out his lack of attendance and last-minute preparation.
### Category: consciousness-17th
Question: What two features does Della Rocca suggest might be the cause of consciousness in Spinoza's representational account of mind?
Answer:Della Rocca suggests that the two features that might be the cause of consciousness in Spinoza's representational account of mind are the complexity of representations and the causal efficacy of ideas (their power).
### Category: newton-principia
Question: What was the shift in focus for philosophers regarding the Principia during the last decades of the eighteenth century?
Answer:The shift in focus for philosophers regarding the Principia during the last decades of the eighteenth century was from questioning the validity of Newton's mathematical theory of forces to spelling out the precise nature and limits of the knowledge attained in this science, determining how this advance had been achieved methodologically, and enabling other areas of inquiry to follow suit in making extraordinary advances.
### Category: ordinary-objects
Question: How might revisionaries attempt to justify their views that are incompatible with ordinary belief?
Answer:Revisionaries may attempt to justify their views that are incompatible with ordinary belief by contending that the mistaken beliefs are nevertheless justified, so long as one is not aware of the defeaters that undercut our usual justification. They may also contend that ordinary speakers are not especially committed to these beliefs, which may suggest that they do not deserve to be treated as data for purposes of philosophical inquiry. Additionally, they may call attention to some respect in which the ordinary utterances and beliefs are “nearly as good as true” in order to justify their revisionary views.
### Category: realism-sem-challenge
Question: What is the philosophical view that equates truth with the coherence of a set of beliefs?
Answer:The philosophical view that equates truth with the coherence of a set of beliefs is called the coherence theory of truth.
### Category: enhancement
Question: How might considering the specific social and institutional contexts of enhancement interventions help in orienting public policy away from regulatory or compensatory approaches focused on enhancement in the abstract?
Answer:Considering the specific social and institutional contexts of enhancement interventions can help in orienting public policy away from regulatory or compensatory approaches focused on enhancement in the abstract by allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of the risks and fairness of particular enhancement interventions. For example, it might lead to considerations about whether the Air Force should consider the post-service consequences of a hyper-reflex enhancement for pilots in deciding whether to adopt such an intervention, or whether enhanced veterans should be able to claim accommodation from employers for their service-induced hyper-responsiveness.
### Category: arrows-theorem
Question: What is the simpler formulation of Condition I that has become standard in expositions of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem?
Answer:The simpler formulation of Condition I states that the social preference must be a function of individual preferences, i.e., social preferences must be determined by individual preferences over the set of feasible options.
### Category: ibn-rushd
Question: Why does Ibn Rushd argue that rhetorical and poetic statements are preferable to dialectical methods when conversing with ordinary people?
Answer:Ibn Rushd suggests that rhetorical and poetic statements are preferable because dialectical methods, in discussion with ordinary people, can be disadvantageous, as shown by the bad example set by the dialectical syllogisms of the mutakallimūn. He establishes this significance in political science, but maintains it even when it comes to teaching and anchoring theological truths.
### Category: logic-dialogical
Question: What does the addition of initial concessions \(A: \bset\) and \(B(x) : \bprop \, [x : A]\) in the thesis indicate compared to the previous one?
Answer:The addition of initial concessions \(A: \bset\) and \(B(x) : \bprop \, [x : A]\) in the thesis indicates that certain assumptions and propositions have been granted for the sake of argument, narrowing down the scope of the argument compared to the previous one.
### Category: logic-conditionals
Question: What is the name of the basic logic system in Adams's conditional logic, which is conservatively extended by several systems that try to extend Stalnaker's Thesis to compound conditionals?
Answer:System P is the name of the basic logic system in Adams's conditional logic, which is conservatively extended by several systems that try to extend Stalnaker's Thesis to compound conditionals.
### Category: ecological-genetics
Question: What issue did Fisher have with using effective population size in his analyses?
Answer:Fisher used extremely high population sizes in his analyses, which were likely far too large in general. He did not pay much attention to the concept of effective population size as he should have.
### Category: austin-jl
Question: What is the viewpoint expressed about the value of commonly used words compared to newly invented ones?
Answer:The viewpoint expressed is that commonly used words have more value because they have survived the test of time and have been used by many generations, making them more likely to be sound and subtle than newly invented ones in ordinary and practical matters.
### Category: freewill
Question: What is one major objection to agent-causal libertarianism that has become less common due to recent philosophical work?
Answer:The objection that the very idea of agent-causation is incoherent has become less common due to philosophical work by Chisholm, Taylor, O’Connor, Clarke, and Steward.
### Category: social-ontology
Question: What is the claim made by Bourdieu (1972) regarding the origin of social practice?
Answer:According to Bourdieu (1972), social practice is generated by a "habitus," which is a mentally internalized system of discrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions.
### Category: game-evolutionary
Question: What is required for a group of strategies to be in a Nash equilibrium?
Answer:For a group of strategies to be in a Nash equilibrium, each agent's strategy must be a best-response to the strategies chosen by the other players. This means that no individual can improve her payoff by switching strategies unless at least one other individual switches strategies as well.
### Category: condemnation
Question: What was likely the status of the Parisian Articles and who had to swear an oath not to maintain anything in their favor?
Answer:The Parisian Articles likely had official status and circulated among medieval scholars. Bachelors in theology were required by oath not to maintain anything in favor of articles that had been condemned at the Roman curia or in Paris.
### Category: dynamic-choice
Question: How might people sometimes cope with toxin-type cases by employing what is more or less a version of rationally inducing irrationality?
Answer:People might sometimes cope with toxin-type cases by engaging in self-deception, indulging in irrational fears or superstitions, such as dwelling on and indulging superstitious fears like the fear that one will be jinxed if one manages to get the million dollars but then does not drink the toxin. This might make it easy for them to form the intention to drink the toxin, even though this is not a solution they can consciously plan on using nor one that resolves the theoretical issues raised by the case.
### Category: connectionism
Question: How does predictive coding help in efficiently transmitting image data?
Answer:Predictive coding efficiently transmits image data by recording at each pixel location the difference between the predicted value (an average of its neighbors) and the actual value for that pixel. This method focuses coding resources on points in the image where there are large changes, such as edges or points of "surprise" or "unexpected" variation.
### Category: universals-medieval
Question: What is the problem of universals about in general?
Answer:The problem of universals is about how universal cognition of singular things is possible. It is concerned with questions such as how we can have awareness of a potential infinity of things, or how we can universally indicate all possible instances of a category with a phrase.
### Category: supervenience
Question: What is the term used when the slogan "There cannot be an A-difference without a B-difference" is applied to entire possible worlds, indicating that two possible worlds cannot differ in A-properties without also differing in B-properties?
Answer:This is referred to as global supervenience.
### Category: turing-test
Question: What additional condition does Schweizer propose for attributing intelligence to machines beyond passing the Turing Test?
Answer:Schweizer proposes that in order to attribute intelligence to machines, there must also be a comparable historical record of cognitive achievements, similar to what we have for human beings, such as development of languages, written scientific treatises, compositions of symphonies, inventions of games, and the like. This is in addition to passing the Turing Test.
### Category: epistemology
Question: How do proponents of Subjective Likelihood Justification (SLJ) view the relationship between deontological justification and sufficient likelihood of truth?
Answer:Proponents of SLJ argue that deontological justification and sufficient likelihood of truth can diverge, meaning that a belief can be deontologically justified without being sufficiently likely to be true.
### Category: skeptical-theism
Question: Can the procedures used in a courtroom to determine guilt apply to the process of forming rational beliefs in philosophy?
Answer:No, the procedures used in a courtroom to determine guilt do not apply to the process of forming rational beliefs in philosophy. It is possible to rationally disbelieve a claim in philosophy even if it is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the claim is false.
### Category: ibn-rushd
Question: Why does Ibn Rushd refuse to use the term 'syllogism' when referring to juridical inferences in his juridical writings?
Answer:Ibn Rushd refuses to use the term 'syllogism' when referring to juridical inferences in his juridical writings because, unlike syllogisms, juridical inferences do not have the power to deduce the unknown from the known. He prefers to focus on the semantic and linguistic origins of juridical rules instead of engaging in a 'syllogistification' of juridical inference.
### Category: anaxagoras
Question: Who was an influence on Pericles according to Plutarch?
Answer:Anaxagoras was an influence on Pericles according to Plutarch.
### Category: atomism-ancient
Question: What were some possible routes of transmission of ancient Greek atomist theories to the Islamic Mutakallimun, aside from direct translation of texts?
Answer:One possible route of transmission was through doxographies, which may have carried Epicurean ideas. Another possible source was Galen's critiques of atomism. Other speculative routes include the Greek sceptical tradition and the supposed atomism of the Pythagorean Ecphantus. Additionally, some scholars have attempted to link kalām atomism to the Indian tradition, citing similarities such as arguments about the equal weight of a mountain and a mustard seed.
### Category: epistemic-game
Question: What is the significance of the central result of epistemic game theory regarding the iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies?
Answer:The central result of epistemic game theory highlights the importance of higher-order information by showing that rationality and common belief in rationality imply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.
### Category: lawphil-nature
Question: What is the main controversy between natural law theory and legal positivism regarding the conditions of legal validity?
Answer:The main controversy between natural law theory and legal positivism concerns whether the conditions of legal validity are purely a matter of social facts (as posited by legal positivism) or if they are also determined by moral considerations (as asserted by natural law). Natural law holds that unjust laws are not valid laws, indicating that moral content is relevant to legal validity.
### Category: nominalism-metaphysics
Question: What are two strategies that nominalists about universals might employ in addressing the existence of alleged universal entities?
Answer:Two strategies that nominalists about universals might employ in addressing the existence of alleged universal entities are rejecting their existence altogether, or accepting their existence but denying that they are universals. These strategies can be implemented by providing nominalistically acceptable paraphrases or analyses of sentences that appear to imply the existence of universals or by giving a nominalistic account of the truthmakers for sentences that are apparently made true by universals.
### Category: medieval-futcont
Question: What is middle knowledge and who introduced this concept in the debate about free will and God's knowledge?
Answer:Middle knowledge is a type of knowledge that God possesses, according to Luis de Molina's theory. This knowledge comprises hypothetical truths about possible beings, specifically what possible creatures would do in any possible situation. Molina introduced this concept in the sixteenth century as a part of the ongoing debate about free will and how God can eternally know the acts of free causes.
### Category: discrimination
Question: Why did the company's promotion policy in the Griggs case qualify as wrong, according to the proponents of the idea of indirect discrimination?
Answer:The company's promotion policy in the Griggs case was considered wrong because it helped to perpetuate unjust disadvantages that were due to structural and direct discrimination, even though the policy was not needed to serve any legitimate business purpose.
### Category: nonidentity-problem
Question: What is the core idea of the person-affecting or person-based intuition in ethics?
Answer:The person-affecting or person-based intuition in ethics suggests that an act can be wrong only if it harms or makes things worse for some existing or future person; acts that maximize wellbeing for all individuals cannot be wrong.
### Category: dirty-hands
Question: Under what conditions might sub-state terrorism be considered excusable, according to Walzer?
Answer:According to Walzer, sub-state terrorism might be considered excusable if it is carried out against civilians with the aim of stopping mass murder of their community and has a significant probability of success, although he seems hesitant in his use of these categories. He uses the example of Jewish militants against German civilians in the 1940s, imagining that such attacks on civilians would have been excusable if they had been likely to stop the mass murder of Jews.
### Category: cognitive-science
Question: What is deep learning an application of, and what fields has it produced major breakthroughs in?
Answer:Deep learning is an application of artificial intelligence that has produced major breakthroughs in fields such as game playing, object recognition, and translation.
### Category: logic-combinatory
Question: What does it mean that both CL\_{	o} and CL\_{=} formalize intensional notions of functions?
Answer:To say that both CL\_{	o} and CL\_{=} formalize intensional notions of functions means that in these systems, functions that produce the same output given the same input may still be considered distinct.
### Category: neuroethics
Question: What are some potential privacy issues that can arise from neuroimaging even if it cannot yet achieve mindreading?
Answer:Neuroimaging can potentially threaten privacy by identifying individuals based on their brain scans and revealing attributes about them that they may not want known, even if they are unaware that their attributes are being probed. This can be concerning even if the subject is willing but may not want certain attributes to be monitored.
### Category: consciousness-17th
Question: Who shares Descartes' view that reflection does not require a distinct thought?
Answer:La Forge and Malebranche share Descartes' view that reflection does not require a distinct thought.
### Category: causation-metaphysics

### Category: bolzano
Question: What was the main question that preoccupied Bolzano in his political philosophy?
Answer:The main question that preoccupied Bolzano in his political philosophy was how to eliminate or at least reduce human suffering and evil in the world most effectively.
### Category: habermas
Question: What does Habermas mean when he uses the term "logical" in a broad sense in relation to arguments?
Answer:When Habermas uses the term "logical" in a broad sense, he is referring to arguments that rely on informal logic as well as formal logic. The strength of these arguments depends on how well all relevant information and possible objections have been taken into account, rather than on deductive certainty. This broad sense of "logical" includes forms of reasoning that resist complete formalization, such as induction, analogy, and narrative.
### Category: feyerabend
Question: What did Feyerabend see as a dangerous element of Popper's philosophy of science?
Answer:Feyerabend saw simplicity as a dangerous element of Popper's philosophy of science, as he believed it may be out of touch with reality and scientific practice.
### Category: sorites-paradox
Question: What is another name for mathematical induction when it is used in the context of a series of logical deductions based on an initial case and a general principle?
Answer:Mathematical induction is also known as "infinite descent" when it is used in the context of a series of logical deductions based on an initial case and a general principle.
### Category: architecture
Question: What is one issue that arises when considering completing unfinished structures?
Answer:One issue is whether it is possible to discern original design intent altogether when completing unfinished structures.
### Category: theophrastus
Question: Why did Theophrastus refrain from offering his own solutions to the conflicting views he presented in his writings?
Answer:Theophrastus refrained from offering his own solutions to the conflicting views he presented in his writings because he wanted to encourage further investigation rather than drive towards an exposition of a full-fledged theory, and he saw his role as providing the preliminary steps of a constructive inquiry that often sets aside general theoretical questions in order to concentrate on the detail.
### Category: malebranche-ideas
Question: Why does Malebranche argue that God creates in the simplest of ways?
Answer:Malebranche argues that God creates in the simplest of ways because it is a consequence of his simplicity, wisdom, and power. This is highlighted in his second consideration of the rational character of creation.
### Category: marxism-analytical
Question: What is one criticism of Cohen's interpretation of Marx that is based on relying too heavily on the "1859 Preface"?
Answer:One criticism of Cohen's interpretation of Marx is that he over-relies on the "1859 Preface," ignoring other concrete accounts of historical development found elsewhere in Marx's own writings (Miller 1984: 188–195).
### Category: church
Question: Who among Church, Kripke, and Myhill shares the view that the axioms of reducibility in Russell's Theory of Types (RTT) only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions while leaving intensional notions unaffected?
Answer:Church, Kripke, and Myhill share the view that the axioms of reducibility in RTT only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions while leaving intensional notions unaffected. This view allows for the full development of classical number theory and analysis in RTT while blocking semantical paradoxes.
### Category: paradox-zeno
Question: What must be done if one does not accept Zeno's argument that motion is illusory?
Answer:If one does not accept Zeno's argument that motion is illusory, then they owe an account of what is wrong with his argument and must show why his reasons are not sufficient. It is not enough to simply point out that there are some ways of cutting up Atalanta's run into which there is no problem.
### Category: madhyamaka
Question: Who are the two kinds of human beings that Śāntideva discusses in his chapter on wisdom in the Bodhicaryāvatāra?

Answer:Dufour (1980) is one recommended source for further reading on complex issues related to this topic.
### Category: church-turing
Question: Why did Turing choose to focus on computable numbers in his paper instead of computable functions, despite initially discussing both?
Answer:Turing chose to focus on computable numbers in his paper because he found their technique to be less cumbersome compared to computable functions.
### Category: machiavelli
Question: What negative outcome does a state that prioritizes security according to Machiavelli bring about in its populace?
Answer:A state that prioritizes security, according to Machiavelli, generates a passive and impotent populace due to its inability to arm its citizens and its dependence on foreigners for military defense, which prevents the society from being truly free (vivere libero) and minimally political or civil.
### Category: emotion
Question: What is one theory about the intentionality of emotions that involves feelings having their own intrinsic intentionality?
Answer:One theory about the intentionality of emotions that involves feelings having their own intrinsic intentionality is proposed by Goldie (2000). According to this theory, feelings such as fear about slipping on ice are towards the object that is causing the emotion, in this case, the ice as being dangerous. This feeling cannot be reduced to a combination of non-intentional bodily feeling and non-emotional evaluative thought.
### Category: chinese-room
Question: What is Hauser's criticism of Searle regarding his intuition about not understanding Chinese while in the room?
Answer:Hauser accuses Searle of Cartesian bias in his inference from "it seems to me quite obvious that I understand nothing" to the conclusion that he really understands nothing. Hauser suggests that Searle may be mistaken and may actually understand Chinese unconsciously.
### Category: nonwellfounded-set-theory
Question: Why does Paulson find it important to reduce AFA (Aczel's Frege Set Theory) to ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice)?
Answer:Paulson finds it important to reduce AFA to ZFC so that he can use an automatic theorem prover to work with assertions in set theory without having to change the underlying set theory. This reduction helps ensure consistency and compatibility with existing work in set theory.
### Category: value-theory
Question: What claim does Dreier make about Agent-Relative Teleology?
Answer:Dreier claims that Agent-Relative Teleology is such an attractive theory that everyone is really committed to it.
### Category: spinoza-modal
Question: How does Spinoza utilize conceptual connections in his explanations of God and the necessity of other entities?
Answer:Spinoza uses geometrical examples to demonstrate the necessity of other things following from God, illustrating his reliance on conceptual relationships in his explanations of God and related entities.
### Category: quotation
Question: What is one source of complexity when dealing with mixed quotation?
Answer:One source of complexity is determining the exact scope of what to include under mixed quotation.
### Category: descartes-physics
Question: What is the issue with Descartes' laws of motion from a relationist perspective, particularly involving the fourth and fifth collision rules?
Answer:From a relationist perspective, there is an issue with Descartes' laws of motion concerning the relational compatibility of the fourth and fifth collision rules. Both rules involve the interaction of a small and large body with the same relative motion (or speed difference) between them. However, rule four concludes that a large object remains at rest during impact with a smaller moving body, while rule five concludes that a large body will move a smaller stationary object. This inconsistency arises because motion and rest are considered different intrinsic states of bodies in Cartesian tenets, which does not hold from a strict relationist viewpoint. The reciprocity of transfer thesis does not seem to resolve this difficulty either.
### Category: kyoto-school
Question: Can ideas that have specific cultural origins be developed into more universally applicable forms through intercultural dialogue?
Answer:Yes, ideas that have specific cultural origins can be critically and creatively taken up and developed into more universally viable forms through intercultural dialogue, as demonstrated by concepts such as democracy, hermeneutics, philosophia, śūnyatā, mu, and the true self as a non-ego.
### Category: realism-theory-change
Question: What claim does Michael Devitt make regarding the success ratio of past theories versus current theories in determining the existence of unobservables?
Answer:Michael Devitt claims that there is an improvement over time in our success ratio for unobservables, meaning that we are now much better at finding out about unobservables with a fairly indubitable historical record of success. This is part of his Privilege-for-current-theories strategy that challenges the inductive credentials of pessimistic arguments regarding unobservables.
Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics assign definite properties to quantum systems even when not being measured. Having a value for an observable in quantum mechanics means the state vector is an eigenstate of the operator corresponding to that observable. The three-box paradox of Aharonov and Vaidman is a paradox in quantum mechanics involving quantum dynamics and incommensurate families of histories. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics assumes the existence of multiple universes. The measurement problem in quantum mechanics refers to the challenge of explaining measurements and results if quantum mechanics is not the fundamental theory.
Meinong defines word meanings as the object presented by a judgment or representation. Non-existent objects like 'the object blue' or 'the object round' are incomplete and necessarily non-existent. The conservative view is that non-actual possible objects do not exist separately from actual existence but represent a "would-be" existence on a counterfactual supposition. Understanding neo-Meinongian objects as correlates of sets of properties may imply a 'creationist' view of fictional objects. Mally claims that conceptual objects are characterized by the negation of the properties that determine them.
1. Twisted self-deception is when someone believes something they don't want to be true on weak evidence, similar to how ordinary self-deceivers believe something they want to be true despite strong evidence to the contrary.
2. Fiction can reveal genuine truths by including statements that are true both within the work of fiction and in reality, such as historical statements in historical fiction or morally/politically significant facts in other types of fiction.
3. A neglected normative notion is when someone complains about something not being done in accordance with a certain standard or rule.
4. Manipulation can be defined as bypassing an individual's rational deliberation, as it circumvents the person's thoughtful decision-making.
5. Deception can occur without the deceiver having a belief about the truth of the false belief they are causing in another person, as seen in the example of Michael convincing Gertrude that the bridge is safe without having any belief about the bridge's condition.
6. Most American, Canadian, Australian, and German children typically develop their understanding of false belief (FB) after they have acquired an understanding of deception (DD), knowledge acquisition (KA), and desire (DB), with happiness/existence (HE) in relation to false belief being the last to be understood.
7. Deception can occur through omission by allowing a person to acquire a false belief or continue with a false belief, and by allowing a person to cease to have a true belief or continue without a true belief, according to Chisholm and Feehan.
James argues that relations are things in a less proper way of speaking, but not in an absolute sense. Instead, he suggests that relations are modes of being of their foundations. Hartshorne criticizes anthropocentrism out of concern for both God and beings-in-becoming who experience reality in a less sophisticated way than humans. Mach argues that we do not perceive the world in itself because if we did we would perceive chaos. Bosanquet sees the mind as a perfection and cooperation of adaptations and acquisitions stored in the body, not as a separate thing independent of the body. Meinong came to believe that value experiences can present not only subjective, personal values but also objective, absolute, impersonal values. McTaggart believed that mysticism requires the recognition of a unity of the universe that is greater than that recognized by ordinary experience or by science. Brentano believes that philosophical disciplines, including aesthetics, are rooted in psychology and would wither without it. James characterizes the reality that is arranged into relations and qualities as not being true reality but rather appearance in his work. Moods can be experienced by purely spiritual beings because they do not have a "bodily nature" or physically felt quality according to Stein (1917).
1. Neutral analogies in Hesse's approach are crucial in scientific discovery as they open up possibilities for expanding our understanding of unfamiliar domains by drawing on what is well-established in more familiar domains through analogy.
2. The process of scientific discovery is compared to puzzle-solving, as both involve trying out different hypotheses or possibilities until the right one is found.
3. Negative analogies play a prominent and constructive role in the development and refinement of theoretical concepts in synthetic biology.
4. The fourth part of the review focuses on describing initiatives proposed by the open science reform movement to improve reproducibility in science, as well as reflecting on the values and norms embodied by those reforms.
5. The process of producing fMRI data is much more convoluted than simple observation methods like looking and photographing, involving complex computations and assumptions.
6. The scientific method uniquely distinguishes itself from other approaches by publicly disclosing the basis of evidence for a claim, allowing for the possibility of anyone reproducing the entire body of scientific knowledge in principle.
7. Effective scientific theories contribute to technological advancements in various fields by enhancing understanding, providing legitimate explanations, assisting in formulating predictions, and playing interventionist roles in consumer, industrial, and scientific milieus.
Jefferson aimed to maximize liberty and potential through republican governing, Berlin differentiated between two forms of political realism, Wollstonecraft proposed friendship as the basis for marriage, new editions of Berlin's works include additional material and forewords, Macaulay suggested fair representation for different interests, Cicero implied philosophers have a public role in discussing government, Berlin's work aligned with liberalism but was difficult to assimilate to postmodernism or multiculturalism, Hume argued for a representative democracy with division of powers, and Burke's political thought was informed by his philosophical understanding and combination of ideas.
#### Summary:

1. In the context of Richard Price, a promisor has a unique relationship with the promisee, as they have directly committed to fulfilling a specific request or action for that individual, whereas others who are aware of the promise only have reason to believe that the promisor will fulfill their commitment.
2. Friedrich Hayek's primary concern regarding merit czars and distribution according to merit is not denying the importance of merit but rather challenging the notion that entitlement doesn't matter. He opposes centralized decisions on merit due to his abhorrence of central planning.
3. The strength of an argument about death may depend on whether 'death' refers to the event of dying or the state of being dead. If 'death' is understood as being dead, it allows for a clearer contrast between the moment of death and the preceding life, which is crucial for the argument's persuasiveness.
4. According to Strawson, it is nonsensical to ask if an entire legal system is legal or not because it would require appealing to some higher legal standards, but there are no such standards external to the legal system in question. Instead, we can only ask whether specific laws or actions within the system conform to its own internal standards.
1. Erin and Harris suggest practical protections for organ donors and recipients when sales are legalized, such as adequate medical care and health checkups.
2. Patient-centered deontological theories focus on people's rights, with a core right against being used without consent.
3. Respecting the intimacy of medical experiences is required by sound ethics, recognizing associational privacy interests.
4. Coercion in organ sales can occur when a vendor charges someone in a situation where there is a duty to rescue.
5. A common question in organ transplantation allocation is whether deviating from principles could lead to more donations.
6. The controversy regarding families' distress when organ donation is considered is the strength of their claim to avoid such distress.
7. An objection to taking organs without explicit consent is based on people's rights over their bodies and the duty of non-interference.
8. Payment for organ donation does not automatically invalidate consent, as it does not inherently mean that consent is not freely given.
#### Summary:

* Southern Song period political thinkers were influenced by historical context, leading them to focus on character improvement for governance.
* Butcher Ding's knife moved harmoniously while carving an ox for Lord Wen Hui.
* Huang studied classics and history to verify changes and transformations of principle.
* Han Fei dislikes rulers who employ scholars based solely on rhetorical skills without considering the political worth of their ideas.
Einstein's argument suggests that the designation of elements as a priori is not determined by a principle, but rather by the totality of elements possessing empirical content. Russell (1913) argues that causality does not have a role in fundamental sciences, and laws governing physical behavior are differential equations that specify exact properties of systems for all time. In the Marburg view, laws play a crucial role in achieving objectivity by relating various appearances at different points of view in a law-like way, moving from appearance to reality.
Beauvoir argues that prioritizing the future over the present can lead to sacrificing the present and result in injustices. The erotic experience reveals human beings' ambiguous condition as both flesh and spirit, and as the other and subject. Matricide is necessary for subjectivity to be achieved, according to Kristeva. Freudianism's cultural impact and theoretical power make it difficult to dismiss claims of its scientific validity. In the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a sexual position by submitting to castration and entering into signification. Judith Butler argues that gender is performative and constituted through the repetition of stylized acts. Lacan views the Oedipal personas as socio-cultural roles that can be played by any number of possible persons of various sexes/genders. Freud argued that dreams and waking life are similar in the context of psychoanalytic theory.
Pease et al.'s (2016) reconstruction of the tomato clade represents an advancement in phylogenetic inference by recognizing specific patterns of discordance in what was previously treated as noise. Homo sapiens is considered an individual because of spatiotemporal continuity and causal processes that account for the coherence between its component parts. Cladism groups organisms according to shared phylogenetic ancestry, while the Linnean system groups them based on shared morphological characteristics. The speciation process is often not instantaneous and can have internal structure within lineages, differing from the simplifying assumption of lineage splits in phylogenetics. The test to determine if two groups of individuals belong to different species is their incapacity to interbreed.
1. In the \(h\)-\(r\)-\(w\) framework, identifying relevant consequences as basic ones using atomic sentences or their negations can lead to many distinct propositions implying the same atomic sentences, which does not satisfy the requirement that \(A\) be equivalent to \(A_R\).
2. A statement \(C\) can be true if, and only if, \(C\) is false in a situation where \(C\) is self-refuting - that is, when \(C\) denies its own truth.
3. The law of the excluded middle asserts that a statement must be either true or false.
4. The false proposition is the negation of P’s affirmation, not P itself.
5. Every property has a negation. This means that for every property that exists, there is also a property which is its opposite or absence.
6. The counterfactual if Thorpe were to win the next General Election, Britain would prosper seems to imply that if Thorpe were to win the next General Election, Britain would prosper.
7. A statement is inconsistent when it is true but implies something that is not true.
8. Moving from the tautology that electrons either are or are not fundamental to embracing the false proposition that electrons are not fundamental would bring you further away from the truth.
1. In the \(h\)-\(r\)-\(w\) framework, identifying relevant consequences as basic ones using atomic sentences or their negations can lead to issues, as many distinct propositions can imply the same atomic sentences.
2. The view that follows Adams 1981 claims that quantified propositions can be true at a possible world even if there are no corresponding singular propositions that could have been true at that world.
3. In supervaluationist logic, both (21) and (22) are deemed truth-valued when treating category mistakes, which incorrectly predicts that they are felicitous.
4. The statement that false mathematical theories are just impossible theories implies that mathematical necessity is unrestricted and not coextensive with logical necessity.
5. Priest defines non-normal worlds as the worlds that correspond to "logic fictions," where the laws of logic may be different from our laws and the rules of inference may not hold as they do in our universe.
6. Supervaluationism rejects inference rules such as contraposition, conditional proof, and reductio ad absurdum that classical logic accepts.
7. Williamson (1982) suggests that an anti-realist should accept intuitionistic logic as a response to Fitch's proof.
8. According to Snowdon, 'P' is equivalent to 'Q' if and only if it is a priori that necessarily (P if and only if Q).
9. Moore proposed the term 'entailment' as an alternative to Russell's account of implication, recognizing its connection to logical necessity but arguing that it is not just a matter of the necessity of the truth-functional conditional.
10. The multiple-reductions argument against platonism in mathematics, specifically arithmetic, asserts that if there are any sequences of abstract objects that satisfy our arithmetical theories, then there are infinitely many; there is nothing that makes any of these sequences stand out as the sequence of natural numbers, but platonism is committed to the thesis that there is a unique sequence of abstract objects that is the natural numbers; hence platonism is false.
1. Integrity constraints in belief-merging ensure the aggregated information satisfies problem-specific requirements, such as resource restrictions and project coexistence constraints.
2. Conditional introduction is an inference rule in propositional logic that involves introducing a supposition to infer \(p \to q\) from \(p\) followed by \(q\).
3. Graph games have been connected with logic due to their fruitful connections and unusual issues, despite not being designed to analyze logical notions per se.
4. Plain Conditionalization is the rule for updating a ranking function when certainty in a particular proposition is gained.
5. Structural rules in logic can affect conjunction, disjunction, and negation, in addition to the conditional.
6. One logic is stronger than another if all its theorems can be derived in the other logic, and if there are theorems in the stronger logic that cannot be derived in the weaker one.
7. The hypothesis that all ravens are black is Hempel-confirmed by observing any object that is not a raven.
8. A minimal inconsistent set of size at least three relative to a transitivity constraint on preferability is {'x is preferable to y', 'y is preferable to z', 'z is preferable to x'}.
* Possible-worlds models explain the necessity in conditionals where the antecedent makes its consequent necessary.
* In plausibility models, informationally equivalent states can be organized in concentric spheres based on plausibility.
* Each leaf in a winning P strategy for a given formula in the game is labeled with a P elementary statement.
* If Duplicator has a winning strategy in the pebble game, it means the two structures agree for sentences using at most p variables.
* The smoothness condition is similar to condition (L) from section 3.2.1, but it is used to make classical entailment compatible with defeasibility or nonmonotonicity in a model.
#### Summary:

* Possible-worlds models explain the necessity in conditionals where the antecedent makes its consequent necessary.
* The problem of accounting for 'compulsion' modals such as 'I cannot but tell the truth' is called the problem of accommodating the 'actuality entailment'.
* In this philosophical context, the truth-value of a propositional constant does not vary with changing circumstances or chronicles, but depends only on the moment in time under consideration.
Jacobi proposed knowing when to stop philosophizing as the solution for dealing with the irrational results of philosophizing. Schleiermacher was born in Breslau, and his father was a clergyman of the reformed church. According to Humboldt, achieving the proposed task will give the human an intuition of his human nature, and the object that made this possible would become a symbol of his accomplished destiny. Christian Wolff is widely regarded as the most important and influential German philosopher between Leibniz and Kant. He is known for his prolific scholarly output, which included contributions to nearly every area of philosophical investigation of his time. Schleiermacher believes that individualism in religion is valuable and that state interference corrupts the nature of religion by attracting the wrong sorts of people into leadership positions within the church and foisting alien political functions onto religious mysteries. Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer believed that Christian virtues, philosophy, and politics were essential subjects for a well-rounded education. Hamann believed that human experience and knowledge were inherently interconnected and disliked attempts to isolate phenomena from other aspects that he felt were intimately connected. Von Hardenberg, also known by his pen name Novalis, was a German philosopher who left behind a complex philosophical legacy that includes discussions of subjectivity, self-consciousness, epistemology, moral theory, political philosophy, interpretation, philosophy of history, religion, existentialism, aesthetics, and philosophy of art. Novalis held that while philosophy may not be able to directly contribute to practical tasks such as baking bread, it can provide us with valuable insights into concepts like God, freedom, and immortality, which he considered to be more practical in the long run than economics. Stirner views human nature as having no universal or prescriptive content, and therefore incapable of grounding any claim about how one ought to live. He sees the left-Hegelians as reproducing the Feuerbachian error of separating the individual from their human essence and setting it above the individual as something to be strived for, and his own intellectual project is described as an attempt to rehabilitate the prosaic and mortal self in contrast to their work. Schlegel's translation of Shakespeare's works is considered to be among the best in German due to his deep understanding of Shakespeare's language and style, as well as his ability to convey the meaning and spirit of the original texts in a way that resonates with German audiences, despite some criticisms regarding subjectivity and romanticization. Scholem does not argue that language is the origin of experience, but rather views it as a vehicle for understanding experience. He never definitively argues this point and it remains a topic of debate among his interpreters.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into topics such as Hume's philosophical position, induction problem, Kant and Hume's views on causality, Hume's criticism of the cosmological argument, Hartley's views, Hume's attitude towards causation in relation to Newton's views, and Hume's contributions to the critical phase of the causation debate.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into topics such as platonism, events, identity-time, tropes, and nominalism. Each answer provides a concise summary of the key points related to the question.
Richard Montague believed that natural language belongs to the academic field of mathematics, based on his view of it as a formal language. Montague treated all predicate arguments as intensions in his theory to allow for the truth of sentences like "John seeks a unicorn" without requiring the existence of a unicorn. Quine (1954) used the label "inclusive" to refer to alternatives of quantificational logic that make allowance for models with an empty domain of discourse. Montague argued that grammar is misleading for the purpose of studying real semantics because he believed that the study of valid inference still suggests that grammar disguises the structure of propositional thought.
1. According to Kim (1988), if epistemology were to abandon its business of justification, it would be going out of business, as it would no longer be addressing its central concerns.
2. An epistemicist might assign some small probability to hypotheses identifying particular thresholds because if they wagered against each number being the threshold, they must have placed a losing bet somewhere in order to make the transition to oldness.
3. The coherentist approach suggests that if a subject knows that the origin of her belief is reliable, then she knows that beliefs coming from this source tend to be true.
4. Harman interprets high degree beliefs in lotteries with many tickets not as graded belief attitudes toward propositions, but rather as full beliefs about objective probabilities.
5. Niiniluoto calls the epistemic estimate of degree of truthlikeness on the evidence "verisimilitude," but since verisimilitude is typically taken as a synonym for truthlikeness, we will stick with expected truthlikeness for the epistemic notion.
6. According to Moser's account, a belief is nondeviantly sustained by a reason when it is causally sustained in a nondeviant manner by both the believing of or assenting to Q (a proposition) and by the association of P and Q (two propositions where P supports Q).
7. Proponents of SLJ argue that deontological justification and sufficient likelihood of truth can diverge, meaning that a belief can be deontologically justified without being sufficiently likely to be true.
1. Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera contributes to the evolution of biological altruism in worker bees by favoring traits that help their mother reproduce, potentially leading to suicidal behavior.
2. Some regions in the population exhibit a pattern of oscillating between defectors and cooperators in evolutionary game theory.
3. Group selection in the context of cumulative adaptation can be vulnerable to 'subversion from within', where individual organisms sabotage complex features of group organization in favor of their own fitness.
4. The evolution of altruism is a central puzzle in the units of selection debate in the philosophy of biology, providing insights into the possibility of group-level selection in addition to individual-level selection.
5. In the cultural evolutionary interpretation of evolutionary game theoretic models, numerical quantities do not correspond to fitness but rather to some other culturally relevant measure of success or value.
6. The quote initiates a discourse that addresses philosophical criticisms of behavioral ecology and its methods.
7. The development of new behaviors in non-human species cannot always be clearly classified as either individual or social learning, as it can involve both.
8. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman argue that women must be disposed to acquire certain preferences even if they are not widely adopted in their local cultural environment for cultural inheritance to overcome natural selection.
1. In the context of realism, the verb "conclude" is used to imply reaching a decision or judgment based on available evidence.
2. In informal logic, the word "because" typically serves as an inference indicator, introducing a premise that provides a reason for believing the conclusion stated before it to be true.
3. In game theory, the phrase "simultaneously with" might indicate that two events occur at the exact same time.
4. When considering two sentences together in logic, one is typically prompted to make an inference or deduce a conclusion based on the relationship between them.
5. In the context of recursive functions, the phrase "A related observation is" at the beginning of a sentence indicates that what follows is related to what has been previously discussed, often as further evidence or support.
6. In the context of eternity, an argument is a group of statements, one of which is claimed to follow from the others.
#### Summary:

* Winsberg argued that the simultaneous confluence of all three features (being based on a model, being stochastic, and involving a computational solution) in computer simulation could raise new epistemological issues.
* Penny Predictor proposes her theory based on an initial segment of the data and predicts the remaining data with high accuracy, while Annie Accommodator proposes her theory after having all the data and accommodates it in her theory.
* William Jevons measured changes in the value of gold by postulating causal relationships between the value of gold, the supply of gold, and the general level of prices using two models.
* Statistical methods were described as key conduits between data and theory, and therefore as crucial components of inferential reasoning.
* John Clendinnen's methodological simplicity that applies to rules instead of statements was accepted as significant by Wesley Salmon in his justification of induction.
1. It is more appropriate to use 'well-being' instead of 'happiness' when discussing what makes life good for an individual because 'well-being' allows for the possibility that non-human beings can also have good lives, whereas 'happiness' implies consciousness and is typically restricted to human beings.
2. Non-cognitivism is the term used to describe the view that moral statements do not have truth-value because they do not express propositions.
3. Some philosophers use the term "telic" or "final" to refer to non-instrumental value, instead of "intrinsic".
4. The concept of "gain in earthly life" is often referred to as worldly or material success, which can include things like wealth, status, and power.
5. Some philosophers call the practice of taking scientific models literally, even if they are not real, "face value practice".
1. Olson's view on parsimony in theory building considers a fact "queer" if including it would result in a lack of parsimony.
2. Resemblance theories of depiction face challenges in explaining how pictures of fictional individuals or genre pictures can resemble what they represent.
3. Jonas Olson's view allows an error theorist to maintain the falsity of both (1) and (2) without claiming all things are permissible.
4. Non-reductive realists may struggle to provide a clear account of paradigmatic relations or relational accidents due to their unique nature.
5. Academic journals like Between the Species and Journal of Animal Ethics publish articles related to moral vegetarianism.
6. Non-cognitivism in metaethical theorizing can be challenging due to the variety of normative theories and differing judgments.
7. Sylvan identifies predation as an insuperable difficulty for vegetarian options in light of ecological facts.
8. Normative fundamentalism may face concerns about the existence of non-robust (putative) base-facts and the need for a non-question-begging explanation of the difference between robust and non-robust base-facts.
9. The core claim of expressivism about the sentence "Murder is wrong" is that it is related to disapproval of murder in the same way as a descriptive sentence is related to a belief.
Summary:

* Scotus' methods for discovering causal relations involve isolating particular causes to discover causal connections.
* Ockham denies the real distinction between the agent intellect and the potential intellect due to his rejection of common essences and belief in the mind's immediate grasp of singular objects.
* One condition for making reliable causal inferences and coming to know causal propositions on the basis of experience, according to Ockham and other fourteenth-century theologians, is the existence of a theory of natural kinds.
* Ockham is a philosopher associated with the medieval problem of universals.
* The syllogistic for composite modal sentences is straightforward and reduced to a few valid consequences, specifically six of them, according to William of Ockham's Summa logicae III-1.
* William of Ockham seems to refer to the principle of the uniformity of nature when he suggests that the causal power of a most specific natural kind can be known through the observation of a single instance.
* The foundational concept in Paul's theory of predication is his doctrine of universals.
* The problem of universals is about how universal cognition of singular things is possible.
1. In contract law, it might be puzzling why a party is still held liable for breach of contract when the promisee did not rely on the truth of warranted information, as it seems there is no harm caused by the breach.
2. Analyzing the concept of causation in law requires understanding implicit concepts from legal usages and aligning them with official definitions.
3. The legal concept of causation is determined by prior events, an actor's conduct, and a subsequent harm or injury.
4. A contract is typically established after an offer has been made when it is met with an appropriate acceptance.
5. Contract law enforces promissory duties indirectly through expectation damages, distinguishing it from tort law, which aims to restore a status quo ante.
6. The "first house rule" in tort law is an example of a legal rule based on policy, not causal discrimination.
7. A performance or return promise is something sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.
8. The company's promotion policy in the Griggs case was considered wrong because it perpetuated unjust disadvantages due to structural and direct discrimination.
Theoretical reflection involves a gaze that looks backward to explain past events and forward to predict future events. Naturalists face the challenge of establishing a science-based distinction between normal and abnormal human functioning. Philosophers often split the explanandum to prevent one form of explanation from merging into another. Bentall and Spaulding et al. develop their theory of the domain empirically, focusing on cognitive science and correlations between clinically significant problems and underlying phenomena.
1. Under the preponderance of evidence standard, the probability threshold for establishing a version of facts in civil disputes is greater than 0.5.
2. The initial hypothesis mentioned in Example 3.1 is h0.
3. The differences between various measures of total evidence in favor of a hypothesis are determined by whether total evidence is measured in terms of probabilities or odds, and whether disparities in total evidence are captured as ratios or differences.
4. A "line of evidence" refers to a sequence of data processing activities that contribute to the inferential process in evidence treatment.
5. This information would provide strong supportive evidence to a hypothesis if considered alone.
1. Skeptical theism requires adding a lemma stating that we have no reason to think that the cases we do not see (noseeums) are not representative of reality.
2. Nozick must deny closure across simplification to maintain his rejection of K and his acceptance of closure across equivalence.
3. Process reliabilism claims a high correlation between process-reliability and justified belief, and between process-unreliability and unjustifiedness.
4. The three main views about the nature of a priori justification are that it is not significantly different from empirical justification, that it rests on a distinct type of internal mental state called rational intuition or rational insight, and that a person can be a priori entitled to believe certain propositions independently of any evidence.
5. In the doctrine of eternal origination, cause and effect is viewed as a relationship between a mover and a moved object.
6. The expectation expressed is that consuming product P will result in the production of Q.
Russell rejects the idea of propositions as separate entities from facts, and believes that religious belief should die out. He advocates beginning philosophical analysis with scientific theories and proposes a translation procedure for sentences with definite descriptions. He also addresses the problem of vacuous singular terms in his work "The Existential Import of Propositions."
1. Buddhist societies might be reluctant to prohibit abortion due to historical advocacy of religious toleration, potential difficulty and cost of enforcement, potential alienation of people, and the karmic cost of imposing laws.
2. It is challenging to accept the idea of structure without embracing at least part of correlation because structure reflects a deeper level of correspondence that builds upon the surface-level relationships represented by correlation.
3. The age difference between a clone and her progenitor could make it easier for the clone to view herself as distinct from the progenitor than if she had been genetically identical to someone her same age.
4. The difference in how we relate to ourselves compared to how we relate to others might stem from the fact that our actions towards ourselves and others can feel different, even if they share similar moral implications.
5. There might be no need to explain why it is wrong to consume wrongfully produced food if the statement is self-evident or widely accepted as true, or if there is a lack of consensus or understanding about what constitutes wrongful food production.
6. The second and third views being referred to are likely forms of egoism where the egoist is not the sole intended beneficiary of morality, but without additional context it is difficult to be more specific about what these views might be.
In the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics, there is no action at a distance because each measurement outcome creates a new world, so there is no need for action at a distance to transmit information between measurement outcomes. EPR think that the correlations between distant systems do not amount to action at a distance between them. One might expect difficulties with the Lorentz invariance of Bohmian mechanics due to its nonlocality because quantum theory itself is also nonlocal, and developing a Lorentz invariant formulation of quantum theory that avoids the vagueness of orthodox quantum theory is challenging. Not every vector in the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces can be expressible in the form of the tensor product of vectors from each Hilbert space.
Guo Xiang proposes "self-transformation" as an alternative to causal agents in explaining being's existence, suggesting it exists eternally without a cause. The downfall of the arrogant dragon in hexagram Qian warns against excessive human pride. Chinese Zen emphasizes sudden enlightenment, denying any process leads to Buddha-nature. Chan Buddhism's humor and absurdity might suggest existentialist leanings. Bodily comportment is crucial in Guishan Lingyou's community to express gratitude and maintain mutual contribution. The Daoist goal is the realization of one's nature and optimizing inborn capacity, leading to the fulfillment of destiny.
Vattimo proposes that overcoming modernity must be understood as Verwindung, which involves twisting or distorting modernity itself instead of progressing beyond it, in Nietzsche and Heidegger's shared view. Nishida refers to the "self-identity of contradictories" as a totality that holds together differences without sublating them into a higher unity. Diderot's Supplément au voyage de Bougainville anticipates the figure of the native ethnographer and generates universal cultural understandings by comparatively examining the foundations of morality and civilization in both Tahitian and European cultures. Watsuji understands 'climate' in a broad sense as not only referring to the natural environment of a given land, but also as encompassing the social environment. Nishida Kitarō is the philosopher associated with the concept of "nothingness" in Japanese Philosophy. A charitable reading of Nishida’s statements on the special place of Japan interprets them as advocating that his country overcome its outdated vision of itself as a colonizing nation, and embrace a global conception of itself as a nation interacting with other nations in a world of mutually defining equals. Ideas that have specific cultural origins can be critically and creatively taken up and developed into more universally viable forms through intercultural dialogue.
1. AQFT faces challenges in constructing models, despite having topological tools to define global quantities.
2. In classical mechanics, testable properties correspond to Borel sets, while in quantum mechanics, only subsets of the state-space corresponding to closed subspaces of the Hilbert space are testable.
3. Quantum fields can be understood in terms of wave functionals that map classical field configurations to probability amplitudes.
4. Quantum computers are not capable of performing computations that classical deterministic computers cannot.
5. The use of physical equivalence to show that unitarily inequivalent representations are not physically significant in quantum physics has been challenged.
6. The behavior of the energy gap is crucial for whether or not the quantum adiabatic algorithm can yield the desired "speed-up".
7. Researchers expect that it will take 5-10 years to build a quantum computer that can achieve quantum advantage over known classical alternatives.
8. A state is defined as being decomposable or separable across algebras associated with regions in algebraic quantum field theory if its restriction to the algebra generated by those algebras is a product state.
9. The crucial axioms in Wightman's field axiomatics of Quantum Field Theory are covariance, microcausality, and spectrum condition.
Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) was influenced by Critical Legal Studies (CLS) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), which motivated scholars to consider the subtle and broad reach of racist ideas and practices. Continental feminists often problematize the traditional Western philosophical dichotomy between the body and mind, and María Lugones' work is used in scholarship on trans issues in Continental feminism. The norm of Assumed Objectivity is problematic because it yields false beliefs, and one example of a normative, revisionary project proposed in response to the critique of traditional philosophical analysis is modifying or adopting new concepts with the goal of promoting social equality. The aim of the transContinental turn in Continental feminism is to incorporate a global view of feminist issues and theories.
1. From Barwise's result, an inference rule can be obtained to justify hypotheses based on their explanatory power.
2. According to a default theory, if we can nonvacuously close a stage under an applicable default, we should do so; otherwise, we do nothing.
3. The AGM system lacks the ability to include conditional beliefs, which prevents it from explaining the logical relationships between conditional defaults.
4. Skeptical consequence based on Reiter's notion of extension does not exhibit cautious monotonicity because of the default theory (\emptyset, Δ), where Δ contains two defaults, as explained in Makinson (1994).
1. Non-monotonicity in grounding theory means that adding new sentences to a set that grounds another sentence may not preserve grounding.
2. Differences between various formulations of the axioms are not crucial for outlining the basic argument, as they mainly concern the objects probabilities are attached to and the argument's conclusion.
3. Formulating (iii) in terms of "only if" is surprisingly hard to formulate in a natural English equivalent.
4. The concept of "incomplete symbol" might not be as fitting as "construction" when applied to propositional functions and propositions, as it would require a significant expansion of the notion.
5. Even if the axioms of a theory are inconsistent or not empirically adequate, resulting in an empty set of admissible structures, we can still have some understanding of the theoretical terms.
6. Extensionality is significant in understanding the unique relevance of certain sums in the given principles, as it ensures that the relevant sums must be unique.
7. The formula mentioned in the quote has conceptual problems, despite appearing elegant, but the specific formula is not provided in the quote.
1. Face value theories of religious language might be considered revisionary rather than descriptive because they seem to be based on contentious theological views about what can be represented in thought and language, rather than accurately reflecting what speakers mean when they use religious language.
2. Lorenzen and Lorenz did not prioritize material dialogues over formal dialogues in their development of the dialogical framework, despite material dialogues being included from the start.
3. We should not criticize speakers for being indecisive about vague terms' borderline cases because speakers lack literal discretion over vague terms, meaning that there is no decision to be made as it is not a matter of linguistic usage.
4. Anti-normativists argue that the term "correct" should not be interpreted normatively in semantics, as dictionaries commonly list both normative and non-normative usages for the adjective "correct."
5. The cognitive significance of indexical beliefs differs from that of non-indexical beliefs because indexical beliefs involve a subject's perspective and context, making them different from non-indexical beliefs which do not involve such subjective elements.
6. The term 'content' is considered contentious in philosophical discussions of what someone thinks or believes, as it can be unclear what assumptions lie behind its use by various philosophers and whether they have the same thing in mind.
7. The peculiarity of phrases like "my believing what you desire" or "my dreading what the thermometer indicated" arises due to the fact that attitudes and their objects must match in their type of content.
1. The individual is claiming inductive support for their belief that all instances of type f also belong to type g, based on their extensive experience.
2. The purpose of using inductive argument (S) is to provide support for the claim that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future, based on its past success.
3. Abduction or Inference to the Best Explanation is the process of drawing a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning, even if that conclusion cannot be proven with absolute certainty.
4. Mathematical induction is also known as "infinite descent" when it is used in the context of a series of logical deductions based on an initial case and a general principle.
1. In the category of knowledge-how, philosophers use terms like "action-based ways of thinking" and "executable ideas" to refer to practical concepts distinct from semantic and observational concepts. These concepts play a central role in explaining behavior and overcoming the interface problem between cognitive and motor representations.
2. In the category of preferences, mentalists categorize agents as having preferences as states of minds (e.g., humans and higher animals) or not having preferences as states of minds (e.g., machines, plants, or institutions).
3. In the category of logic-normative, having formally incoherent attitudes, according to Kolodny (2007), means one must be violating some requirement of reason, as one of these attitudes is at odds with the reason for it, even if it were not part of an incoherent set.
4. In the category of supervenience-ethics, normative necessity can be understood as facts that follow from fundamental normative laws or principles, similar to how nomically necessary facts follow from laws of nature.
5. In the category of rationality-instrumental, the difficulty faced by the weaker view, which suggests that we have a reason to be instrumentally coherent as such, is that it cannot explain the "strictness" of the Violation Claim, which holds that whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates some requirement.
6. In the category of practical-reason, both Humeans and Kantians seem to agree on the idea that there are structural requirements on our attitudes when it comes to practical and theoretical deliberation, acknowledging a kind of rational pressure to bring our beliefs and intentions into compliance with the instrumental principle and other standards of consistency and coherence.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, specifically focusing on recursive functions, logic, computational complexity, and higher-order logic. The questions cover topics such as the definition of cardinals, computable functions, and the definability of graph connectivity. The answers provide concise explanations and definitions for each topic.
#### Summary:

1. Jenkins (1997) described knowledge obtained through a cognitive process designed to attain truth as being arrived at by the proper operation of such a process, even if it is infused and not natural.
2. According to Aquinas, practical reason's primary function is facilitating and positive, which involves finding and constructing intelligible ends to be pursued, as opposed to Kant's view that practical reason's function is to limit and channel one's pursuit of subjective ends established by subrational desires.
3. The mental habit or act of conscience (and its sister-concept of synderesis) has seen less scholarly attention compared to other topics in medieval moral psychology, although interest in this subject has recently seen a modest resurgence.
4. Synderesis is related to the natural will, according to Philip.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized by topics such as Francisco Sanches, Al-Kindi, Proclus, Lefèvre d'Étaples, Aristotle, Arabic-Islamic mysticism, Skeptical theism, Medieval philosophy, Francis Bacon, Descartes, Economics, Prior, Zeno of Elea, Porphyry, Lefèvre d'Étaples, Bentham, School of Salamanca, Latin American philosophy, Omar Khayyam, and more. Each answer provides key points and information related to the respective question.
1. Plato's motivation for writing the Republic is to transform political life, and he shows interest in practical matters in works like Laws.
2. Western biomedical students traveling to low- and middle-income countries without proper skills and knowledge can negatively impact communities.
3. To demonstrate that moral duties that seem non-binding could be binding, we need a method to justify them.
4. Stocker evaluates alternatives in an absolute sense by considering whether they are excellent of their kind.
5. Determining which beings have human dignity based on certain capacities can lead to inconsistencies.
6. The modified memory criterion allows us to determine if A is the same person as an earlier B, even if A cannot remember enough of what happened to B directly.
7. Wendt describes a world state that could collectivize organized violence without necessarily collectivizing culture, economy, or local politics on a global scale.
8. Van Inwagen argues that the production of an analysis of abilities is not an answer to the incompatibilist's arguments against compatibilism.
9. Cohen argues that the real problem with exploitation is not that capitalists appropriate value created by labor, but rather that they appropriate some of the value of the products that labor creates.
10. Mill sees pleasure as having a complex relationship with character in his ethical theory.
11. Gu compared scholars to sages, emphasizing their inseparable connection between learning and socio-political concerns.
12. Contractualism differs from utilitarianism by rejecting the interpersonal aggregation of burdens and seeking principles that benefit each person individually and command each person's free assent.
13. Appealing to the Mohist conception of Heaven risks circularity in justifying their normative stance.
14. Constitutive luck challenges the Control Principle in moral assessment by suggesting that both actions and agents can be significantly influenced by factors beyond their control.
15. The condition that makes certain separations problematic in the context of alienation is that they violate a baseline harmony or connectedness between the relevant entities.
16. The social contract device can be used in political philosophy in several ways, depending on how one answers three key questions.
17. Judgments about the relative magnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions are non-local or context sensitive.

26. Claudia Card has been criticized for classifying marriage and motherhood as evil institutions.
27. Plato does not concern himself with making his ideal city more livable because his aim is to present a model and work out its essential features, not to predict and explain the course of history or to create a city that is actually livable for its citizens.
28. Population stratification increases the likelihood of false positive SNPs in GWAS because human populations exhibit ethnic or cultural subgroups with distinct allele frequencies.

32. Schiller argues that beauty creates a state of equilibrium that puts the will in a position of maximum power and self-determination, making it "the most fruitful of all in respect of knowledge and morality."
33. One criticism of queer theory by those who advocate for gay liberation as radical social change is that it may rob gays and lesbians of their distinctiveness and marginalization, desexualizing identity when the issue is about sexual identity.
34. The principle of sufficient reason is the principle that states that everything must have a reason or cause.
35. Massimo Renzo sketches a response to the challenge of unjust associations by focusing on what makes a person a member of a political society through a "quasi-voluntarist reformulation of the associative model."
36. Philosophy literature has not given much attention to understanding when it is proper to break off a friendship or allow it to lapse.
37. The goal of notational consequentializing is to establish that in every instance, the target non-consequentialist theory and the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory are mere notational variants of each other.
38. According to Kant, we do not have theoretical knowledge that we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible experience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free in this sense.
39. Nietzsche argues that we should move beyond judgments of good and evil because they do not describe a moral reality, but are merely used to demonize enemies, promote the weak in spirit and suppress the strong, and they contribute to an unhealthy view of life which judges relief from suffering as more valuable than creative self-expression and accomplishment.
40. Some conclusions of rational analysis might seem normatively unreasonable due to the limitations of the analytic method, which may not always account for all relevant factors or perspectives in a given situation.
41. Will Kymlicka outlines the following steps in Robert Nozick's argument for self-ownership: (1) individuals have moral property rights in their bodies, (2) these rights include the right to transfer ownership of one's body and labor to others, (3) these transactions are inviolable and do not require justification, and (4) interference with these transactions is impermissible and equivalent to slavery or forced labor.
42. Nietzsche suggests that art serves as a counterforce against the honesty of recognizing the general untruth and mendaciousness of human knowledge and sensation, helping us to avoid nausea and suicide by providing a good will to appearance.
43. Douglass argued that blacks were humans, not beasts, and that slavery had brutalized them.

45. Considering the specific social and institutional contexts of enhancement interventions can help in orienting public policy away from regulatory or compensatory approaches focused on enhancement in the abstract.
46. Fisher used extremely high population sizes in his analyses, which were likely far too large in general. He did not pay much attention to the concept of effective population size as he should have.
47. The person-affecting or person-based intuition in ethics suggests that an act can be wrong only if it harms or makes things worse for some existing or future person; acts that maximize wellbeing for all individuals cannot be wrong.
48. According to Walzer, sub-state terrorism might be considered excusable if it is carried out against civilians with the aim of stopping mass murder of their community and has a significant probability of success.
49. Neuroimaging can potentially threaten privacy by identifying individuals based on their brain scans and revealing attributes about them that they may not want known, even if they are unaware that their attributes are being probed.
50. The core idea of the nonidentity problem is that the future people who would exist if a certain action is taken are different from the future people who would exist if that action is not taken, making it difficult to determine the moral rightness or wrongness of the action.
1. Theoretical pluralism can be difficult to decide due to empirical claims, trade-offs with simplicity, and practical reasons.

23. Feyerabend saw simplicity as a dangerous element of Popper's philosophy of science, as he believed it may be out of touch with reality and scientific practice.
Sellars believes that the concepts of folk psychology cannot be replaced by the language of any scientific theory because they have a function that goes beyond just describing and explaining phenomena. Cain Samuel Todd is an eliminativist when it comes to imaginative resistance, meaning he believes it is not a real phenomenon and does not exist outside philosophers' carefully constructed scenarios. Wright refuses to theorize about sense data and instead grounds empiricism in the type of data available to everyday perceiving. Sellars rejects classical theories that try to understand truth through some correspondence relation purported to hold between sentences and the world in favor of a pragmatist conception of truth.
Latin American philosophy is notable for its early consideration of philosophical nature and significance, with debates about what qualifies as philosophical inquiry. Meléndez's 1998 book explores the notion of truth from Wittgenstein's perspective, challenging attempts to construct a general theory of truth. Catarina Dutilh Novaes describes the relevance of conditions in Moulines' understanding of Latin American philosophy. The central problem in the philosophy of liberation is the issue of the historical subject of liberation. Contemporary process-philosophical research aims to revise long-standing theoretical habits. Experimental psychology, positivism, and utilitarianism gained interest in China due to the emphasis on mathematics and science. Epistemology is a subfield of philosophy that focuses on the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge and justified belief. Agustín Rayo is an example of a Mexican analytic philosopher who has developed strong ties with philosophical departments outside of Mexico. The critical discussion of Mally's philosophical work began in the 1990s. A recent trend in Mead scholarship is to reframe Mead's legacy by focusing on his published written canon. One distinguishing feature of Mexican philosophy is its particular concern with ethical and political issues. León Olivé's recent work focuses on how technology has pervaded contemporary society.
Chatton argues for the existence of quantities as a distinct ontological category for propositions about quantified properties. Aristotle questions the unity of species or secondary substance due to the different ways properties belong to objects. Hylomorphism is the philosophical concept that objects have both form and matter as fundamental aspects of their nature. The Port-Royal Grammar asserts that substances are ontologically prior to their attributes in language. In Plato's philosophy, a Form is related to its essence through the predication relation of Being. Similitude binds together the members of Dietrich's hierarchy of being. Wolff distinguishes between real individuals and nominal beings based on completeness and determinateness. Non-substantial particulars cannot exist independently from primary substances, according to Aristotle's theory. Simon's twofold account of individuation provides an alternative to the Averroistic solution for the individuation of immaterial beings.
The first question and answer pair discusses how Indian Buddhist epistemologists categorize "ultimate" and "conventional" truths in the Madhyamaka framework. The second pair explains Sapaṇ's argument against the reality of cognitive and linguistic objects due to their association with the false reification of the self and their impermanence. The third pair defines conventional truth according to Gorampa as the shared experiences and linguistic conventions of ordinary beings. The fourth pair explains Sapaṇ's view on the relationship between wholesomeness and actions, where wholesomeness is determined by the happiness or pain caused by an action. The final pair summarizes the two fundamental theses of the Prāsaṅgika's theory of the two truths, which are the existence of conventional and ultimate truths, with only ultimate truth being truly existent.
1. Paul Marshall argues that extrovertive mystical experiences are complete experiences in their own right and not merely stunted introvertive ones, and has developed a detailed phenomenology of these experiences.
2. McTaggart is an ontological idealist who believes that all that exists is spiritual, and supports this view through various considerations, including relying on Bradley's views about contradictions as a criterion for non-reality, employing mereological considerations concerning the structure of substances, and presenting arguments based on his theory of time.
3. According to James, the supreme good in the universe is the existence of a personal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign, as suggested by the first and third affirmations of religion.
4. Systematic metaphysicians, such as McTaggart, typically defend various metaphysical views while on their way to defending one particular view.
Summary:

* Socialism is associated with Friedrich Engels.
* Libertarian theories can be classified as right-libertarian or left-libertarian based on their stance on natural resource ownership constraints.
* Nozick refers to a network of protective associations as the dominant protective association.
* Gift goods are differentiated from economic goods by their production, distribution, and enjoyment governed by norms other than market norms.
* Marx's views on communism can be interpreted as a theory of justice or as transcending justice.
* Intellectual property is an example of property relations that does not respond directly to scarcity.
* Eliminativism about firms is the view that firms do not have an independent existence.
* Buchanan's contractarianism supports a "productive" state that provides tax-financed goods and social insurance as part of his redistributive measures.
* Nozick is not accusing patterned theories of forbidding the exchange between individuals under patterned distributions.
Theodor Adorno believes art should denounce injustice, not distract with beauty. Kant suggests imagination and understanding harmonize in aesthetic experience. Reiter and Geiger propose the concept of an "aesthetic normal idea" to understand Kant's theory. Benjamin's work reveals the relationship between Romantic aesthetics and history. Kant suggests a feeling of a supersensible faculty is awakened when we become aware of the inadequacy of our sensible faculties.
The smallest set containing numerals, variables, and closed under operations \(t \mapsto s(t)\) and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n \mapsto \psi^n_i(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is called the class of terms. A microsymmetry group \(G_{p}\) at point \(p\) in a metric structure is a set of invertible, linear maps of the tangent space \(T(M_{p})\) onto itself, which preserve the infinitesimal distance function at \(p \in M\). The abstract group that is isomorphic to \(G_{p}\) is the same for every \(p \in M\). The notation \(M[x:=N]\) is typically seen as the notation for the value of an expression that results from substituting \(N\) for the variable \(x\) in the matrix \(M\). The principle stated is that if a function maps \(A\)s to \(B\)s and \(A\)s to \(C\)s, then it maps \(A\)s to things that are both \(B\) and \(C\). The concept is called the "image function" or "iteration of a mapping on a set", denoted by \(\gamma_{o}(A)\). The exponential function in equation (4) that calculates the time discount factor is called \(e^{-\delta}\). \(\mathcal{PrimRec}_k[f,g]\) denotes the unique function of type \(\mathbb{N}^{k+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) obtained by applying primitive recursion on functions \(f\) and \(g\), where \(f\) is of type \(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) and \(g\) is of type \(\mathbb{N}^{k+2} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\). If \(a\) is assumed to equal \(1 - a\), then \(a\) would equal \(1/2\). The mathematical expression for the summation of a set of sigmas of individual elements (s-subj) in a set S is given by equation (ef{eqn30}), S = ∑j σj [sj].
1. Zhu-Xi: Levitin suggests that being sensitive, alert, discerning, and responsive are optimal learning strategies for a fulfilling life.
2. Causation-Law: The Critical Legal Studies movement, or "Crits," was an intellectual descendant of American Legal Realism's skepticism in legal theory, popular in the 1970s and 1980s.
3. Sex-Sexuality: Excluding one's own gender from sexual orientation can maintain consistency after gender transitions, with potential political and moral advantages.
4. Progress: Doctrines of progress first emerged in 18th-century Europe, but philosophical support waned in the 20th century due to horrific events.
5. Homosexuality: The term "post-gay" refers to a hypothetical culture of widespread LGBTQ acceptance, where sexual orientation is no longer a defining aspect of one's identity or social position.
6. Pascal-Wager: The "gain in earthly life" is often referred to as worldly or material success, including wealth, status, and power.
7. Consciousness: Consciousness in the meta-mental sense may enhance understanding of other minded creatures' mental states, leading to improved social coordination.
Aristotle's theory of scientific claims in the Posterior Analytics i.4 involves three crucial notions: 'of every', 'per se' or 'in virtue of itself' in four ways, and 'universally'. Discussions on Aristotle's lists of categories have been further explored by Frede 1981 and Ebert 1985. In the context of someone maintaining a thesis, Aristotle requires a refutation to consist of asking questions, using the answers as premises, and deducing the contradictory of the thesis. The concept of the connection between substance and teleology is discussed in section 3.5, which is related to Aristotle's account. Aristotle's account of homonymy allows for partial overlap between different uses of the same term.
The Law of Effect asserts that responses accompanied by positive feelings are more likely to be associated with the situation, while responses with negative feelings make the response less likely. Helmholtz gives the example of grasping a pen to illustrate a judgment of relative spatial position. The activation strength of an associate with fewer connections becomes weaker, causing it to be activated more slowly. Fechner proposed a method for measuring intensities of sensation based on recording just noticeable differences between sensations associated with pairs of stimuli. Wundt calls the process of synthesizing ever more representations based on compressed or displaced original associative or agglutinated representations "representational synthesis" proper. Herbart likened the total of opposed inhibitory forces in the system of two (or more) opposed representations to an 'inhibition-sum'. One aspect of character's objective side is its dependence on the child's susceptibility to formation and individuality. Moving the observing eye and the touching finger forwards and backwards generates an unfathomable manifold of visible and tangible representations.
1. Hermann Weyl believed that mathematics should be extended to include notions beyond intuition only if it plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences.
2. Brumfiel did not use the transfer principle in his method of proof, but the text does not provide an explicit reason for this decision.
3. Wittgenstein would likely argue that P, as a syntactically independent expression, is not a proposition of PM and has no useful purpose beyond performing "bits of legerdemain."
4. Hilbert's foundational book, "Grundlagen der Geometrie," laid the groundwork for the central foundational problems of mathematics in the early 20th century.
5. The truths of Euclidean geometry were not subject to Frege's doctrine of logicism because he considered them to be synthetic a priori and founded in a different way from the truths of arithmetic.
6. Weyl criticized Hilbert's project as replacing contentual mathematics by a meaningless game of formulas and suggested that consistency of a formal system of mathematics is not enough to believe in the truth of the pre-formal mathematics it codifies.
7. Hermann Weyl may have become disenchanted with intuitionism in mathematics due to the mathematical sacrifices required by the strict adherence to intuitionistic doctrine.
8. It is coherent to maintain that mathematics is the science of formal systems even after the incompleteness theorems were proven.
9. Detlefsen argues that Hilbertian instrumentalism only requires real-soundness, which means that ideal mathematics must not prove anything that conflicts with real mathematics.
10. Wittgenstein argues that infinite sets are not extensions and that it is not possible to prove that one infinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set.
The symbol "\(\vee\)" in logic represents the logical disjunction between statements, where at least one of the two statements can be true. A functional inverse of a function is a function that reverses the original function. The logical conjunction "\(\amp\)" in English means "and" and indicates that both parts of the conjunction must be true. The symbol used to represent the conjunction "and" in logic is usually the ampersand (&) or the wedge (∧). The convention regarding the scope of logical connectives when parentheses are not used in a logical formula is that \(\equiv\) has wider scope than \(\lor\) and &amp;, and \(\lor\) and &amp; have wider scope than \(\osim\). Additionally, \(\equiv\) has wider scope than \(\supset\). It is ungrammatical to write "\(\unary{f} \inclusion \binary{m}\)" because \(\binary{m}\), being a binary predicate, cannot have an inclusion relation with a unary predicate \(\unary{f}\). Peirce uses the symbol \(\inclusion\) to represent inclusion. In the given quote, Peirce defines "involution" as denoting everything which is an \(x\) for every individual of \(y\). The abbreviation "iff" stands for "if and only if" in logic.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into topics such as meaning, Bolzano-logic, propositions, structured propositions, Burley, logical construction, Frege, and Platonism. The questions cover various aspects of philosophy, including the Fregean view of propositional constituents, the distinction between predicate negation and propositional negation, the status of false propositions in Bolzano's second theory of semantics, and the concept of the course-of-values in Frege's work.
1. The choice of scale in historical research is important as it can yield different insights and findings, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the past.
2. Information is a core concern for philosophy from a metaphysical perspective as it is thought to constitute or be closely correlated with our existence and the universe's operation.
3. The conception of childhood is crucial in various fields as it impacts how we understand and treat children, influencing their legal status and behavioral studies.
4. Information technology plays a pivotal role in organizing our lives in society.
Robert Grosseteste did not set up controlled experiment as the primary method for scientific knowledge, but he related it to demonstrative science. Albert the Great and Henry of Langenstein shared Oresme's view of the Milky Way. Thomas of Erfurt wrote a Modist textbook misidentified as Duns Scotus's work. Meister Eckhart was elected Provincial of the Province of Saxony in 1303. Francis of Marchia was an exciting theologian at the University of Paris. John Scottus Eriugena expressed the view of the harmony of the spheres. Ockham and sympathetic Franciscans fled to Italy in 1328. Many philosophers in the later fourteenth century were influenced by Gregory of Rimini's ideas. Grosseteste is believed to have been Oxford's first chancellor. Oresme served Charles, the dauphin of France, and held various ecclesiastical positions until his death in 1382.
The first question discusses the use of inductive argument (S) in justifying the supposition that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future. The second question provides an example of a problem where the principle of indifference seems to work well. The third question discusses the issue of determining unique priors with the principle of indifference. The fourth question discusses David Lewis's remarkable result regarding the existence of a proposition \(A*B\) such that \(\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \mathbf{p}_A (B)\) in all probability distributions. The fifth question discusses the third axiom of probability theory and how it explains figuring out the probability of a hypothesis. The sixth question discusses how Joyce uses the Principal Principle (PP) to justify a preference for betting on a fair coin over an unknown bias coin with the same subjective probabilities. The seventh question discusses the condition for an ethically neutral proposition to have a probability of 1/2 for a given agent.
The purpose of using inductive argument (S) is to provide support for the claim that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future, based on the success of past instances of arguments that relied upon it. Nelson Goodman proposes that we should justify rules of inductive logic by bringing them into reflective equilibrium with what we judge to be acceptable inferences in a broad range of particular cases. Spohn's ranking-theoretic approach to causation addresses scenarios of overdetermination in a way that is similar to probabilistic accounts of this type of causal situation. One possible way to address pseudo-overdetermination in Swain's theory is by specifying the types of changes in one's epistemic situation that are consistent with it, and then ruling out any additional unwarranted inferences as inconsistent with such changes.
1. In interval-based temporal logic, an interval model is a triple \(\mathcal{M} = \langle T,\prec,V\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) is a temporal frame, and \(V\) is a valuation function that assigns to each atomic proposition \(p\) a set of time intervals \(V(p) \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{I}(\mathcal{T}))\) at which \(p\) is considered true.
2. If there were no distinct objects with identical mass in any domain, then according to the invariance criterion, the approximation sign (\dq{\approx}) would count as a logical constant and "\dq{\forall x (x \approx x)}" would be a logical truth.
3. The predicates are related to each other through four simple axioms, namely (34)-(37). These axioms connect all variables with universal quantifiers and the maximum scope. The semantics of implication will be discussed when the whole scenario has been presented.
4. When an asynchronous formula occurs on the right of a sequent in proof search as a computational model, it can evolve without affecting provability and without interacting with its context. This is because the corresponding introduction rule is invertible.
5. It might be reasonable to assume restrictions regarding the set of chronicles and its use in the semantical model in the Leibniz-theory because there are potentially many maximal linear subsets in the branching time structure, and not all of them may be relevant or necessary for the purposes of the semantics.
6. The permutation invariance criterion, as it has been stated so far, only applies to extensional operators and connectives. Therefore, it is of no help in deciding whether operators such as the necessity operator in S4 modal logic or the H operator in temporal logic are bona fide logical constants. The invariance criterion can be extended to handle intensional operators by relativizing truth not just to an assignment of values to variables but also to a possible world and a time. However, this extended criterion can be quite stringent and may not count certain operators as logical constants if they are sensitive to structure on the domains of worlds and times, as is the case with the S4 necessity operator and the H operator in temporal logic.
Stoicism emphasizes the importance of living virtuously and in accordance with moral duty, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the welfare of all humans as fellow-citizens in a cosmic city. The Stoic sage has an unconditional desire to live virtuously and views virtue as sufficient for happiness, as there is no conflict between duty and happiness. The Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis explains our natural tendency to care for others, starting with our family and friends and ultimately extending to our fellow-citizens and fellow-humans. Understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way nature arranges the whole universe is essential in Stoicism, as it forms the basis for living in agreement with the government of the universe (nature) and contributing to the overall good. In the Hellenistic culture of Ancient Greece, striving for perfection in body and mind through sport played a major role in society and served as one of its principal unifying activities. According to Lipsius, virtue and wisdom come from God, who is the source of all knowledge.
Dilthey sees Schleiermacher and Kant as making progress in articulating the Christian insight into inwardness and historicity of life. Scheler understands the religious act in positive religion as a response to a personal revelation of the divine. Lotze arrives at the conclusion of objective idealism regarding the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity. Dilthey aimed to establish independent epistemological foundations of research in the human sciences. Ward likely gained his first substantial appreciation of Leibniz's philosophy from Rudolf Hermann Lotze. Lotze was one of the earliest influences on Heidegger's philosophical thought. Gadamer views prejudices in a positive light as what open us up to what is to be understood. Lotze seeks to emend the Fichtean subjugation of theoretical reason to practical reason by treating action as a formal concept. Heidegger suggests that our scientific theories are historical artifacts that we use in technological practice. Re-experiencing contributes to understanding in the hermeneutical circle by going "forward" through the parts that give focus to the whole.
1. The Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP) leads to the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for acting virtuously because they cannot do anything other than the virtuous action in any situation.
2. People have anti-results-luck intuitions and lay theories when it comes to judgments of blameworthiness in scenarios involving moral luck, often attributing negligence to agents in harmful scenarios.
3. Manipulation is often used as a criticism against nudges because it is perceived as failing to respect our autonomy as rational and capable choosers.
4. Some moral realists argue that moral disagreements can be traced back to the distorting effects of emotions, attitudes, and interests that are bound up with moral issues.
5. It can be rational to trust moral emotions rather than moral beliefs even if they diverge, as emotions can be attuned to respond to other cases where a promotion has been granted unfairly.
6. If some believers can rule out all other members of the modest contrast class, it does not necessarily mean that nobody can ever rule out moral nihilism.
1. John Stuart Mill proposes that intellectual pleasures are superior to other pleasures based on the preference of those who have experienced both, implying that intellectual pleasures have higher value.
2. Society has jurisdiction over an individual's conduct when it negatively affects the interests of others, according to Mill.
3. W. S. Jevons, F. Y. Edgeworth, Sidney Webb, and Graham Wallas were economists influenced by Bentham's utilitarian ideas, developing his theories in various ways.
4. Bentham's view creates a conflict between psychological egoism and morality's other-regarding demands by combining ethical and psychological claims about happiness.
5. Mill attributes more intuitive and practical qualities to women, while men are seen as more principled and theoretical.
6. The purpose of mental education, according to Mill, is to foster a sense of joint interests and guide conduct by aims that unite individuals.
7. Mill's critics, including Sidgwick, F.H. Bradley, T.H. Green, and G.E. Moore, noted an apparent inconsistency between his higher pleasures doctrine and traditional hedonism.
Empirically-minded critics argue that traditional virtues may not be realistic for most people's development. Armstrong addresses the issue of what the lawmaking relation is in response to van Fraassen regarding laws of nature. Goddard and Routley criticize philosophers who are too hasty in labeling statements as gibberish or ungrammatical without proper justification. Strauss argues that philosophy cannot refute or confirm belief in revelation because they rely on different modes of understanding. Assumptions introduced as hypotheses at the discovery level serve as a wager that is tested in the context of justification.
1. Schutz's thought preserves agents' potential to resist societal control by contrasting Bourdieu's account of habitus (Dreher 2019).
2. The 'coat-rack' view of gender sees sex as the biological foundation upon which cultures construct social interpretations of gender.
3. Non-egoistic species-drives in Feuerbach's philosophy are psychological manifestations that individuals periodically find themselves overwhelmed by, representing the species-essence of humanity.
4. The social model of disability views disability as a mere difference and the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization that takes little or no account of people who have physical impairments.
5. Some philosophers understand domination as fundamentally a relationship between groups, where any domination between individuals is considered parasitic on group membership.
6. Witt defines social individuality in terms of the extrinsic feature of occupying a social position, which depends for its existence on a social world.
7. When a thought collective's thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated within more developed societies, the collective breaks into a small esoteric circle of specialists and a wide exoteric circle of members who are under the influence of the style but do not play an active role in its formation.
8. E.B. Tylor defines culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capacities acquired by man as a member of society.
9. Cohen views an individual's striving for moral improvement as establishing a personal and particular correlation with God.
10. On the view that external forces construct social identities as a way to divide and rank, an individual still has the freedom to engage in self-making apart from their socially constructed racial identity.
1. Double-consciousness in Du Bois's Souls refers to the internal conflict experienced by people of African descent in America due to societal racial prejudices.
2. Frantz Fanon focused most of his writings about Africa in North Africa, particularly in Algeria.
3. Thomas Jefferson regretted losing his books in a fire at Shadwell in 1770 due to his deep passion for learning and the value he placed on books.
4. Fanon's concept of the inferiority complex explains how anti-Black racism is internalized by Black people living under colonial rule, affecting their self-perception.
5. Locke claims that young artists, specifically young American Negroes, speak in distinctive overtones and represent unique experiences in the Harlem Renaissance.
6. Noah Webster is considered one of the founders of the public-school system in the United States due to his efforts in promoting universal education and creating his own speller and dictionary.
7. The Future of Africa (1862) is one of Crummell's books that focused on his early thinking about morality and language.
8. John Locke was the individual that Anthony Collins met in 1703, visited multiple times over the next year and a half, and corresponded with about philosophical topics.
Auguste Comte is known as the founder of positivism, a philosophical and political movement. St. Augustine considered lust within marriage as a venial sin, as long as it is not the sole reason for the marital sexual act. Auguste Comte is often considered the father of sociology and developed the “law of three stages” theory of social development. In his later life, Augustine took the position that intolerance and use of force could be a Christian duty if it was the only way to save the soul of another and if it were used in conjunction with right teaching. The controversy about God's grace was most evident in the discussion of free will. The doctrine of divine illumination can be traced back to the ancient period and was most influentially developed by Augustine and his scholastic followers. St. Augustine is often credited with offering the first justification of the Christian prohibition on suicide. The four traditional layers of meaning given to biblical texts in early Christian hermeneutics were historical (or literal), allegorical, tropological (or moral), and anagogical (or spiritual).
Spinoza's philosophy is discussed in various aspects, including his relationship with Henry More, his views on freedom and toleration, his arguments against the idea of humans having their own set of rational, normative laws, his interpretation of 'good' and 'evil', and his account of causation. The relationship between God's essence and God's infinite intellect in Spinoza's philosophy is also explored, as well as his interpretation of the terms 'good' and 'evil' in IIIp39s and its contribution to his ethical naturalism. The naturalistic equivalent of a right of revolution proposed by Spinoza is also discussed, along with Garrett's interpretation of Spinoza's denial in Ip28 and its implications for the relationship between finite modes and God's absolute nature. Malebranche's argument for God creating in the simplest of ways is also mentioned, and Spinoza's reliance on conceptual relationships in his explanations of God and related entities is highlighted.
1. The L-particle may have different spin properties as a separated system and as a subsystem of the particle pair in the state |ψ11>.
2. The property represented by the projector Pi^alpha on H^alpha is usually assumed to be the same as the property represented by Pi^alpha 	o I^beta on H^alpha 	o H^beta due to observational indistinguishability.
3. BDMI is directly applied to the quantum measurement problem in an ideal measurement according to the standard von Neumann model.
4. The coefficients of vector \(B\) in the \(A\)-basis are known as \(B\)’s expansion coefficients in the \(A\)-basis.
5. One condition for the conditional wave function of a subsystem to obey Schrödinger's equation is that the subsystem is suitably decoupled from its environment and that the total wave function has a special form called an effective product form.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, covering various categories such as plural-quant, connectives-logic, quantification, tense-aspect, logic-higher-order, logic-deontic, logic-justification, model-theory, logic-dependence, phil-multimodallogic, logic-higher-order, and recursive-functions. The answers provide information about special and universally representative connectives in logic, the relationship between extending PFO+ with quantification into predicate positions and second-order logic, the second-order version of universal generalization, and the equivalence of dependence logic in terms of second-order logic, among others.
1. In Locke's philosophy, God and potentially angels can attain scientia in natural philosophy.
2. Hume differs from Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley by not accepting the existence of an inner perception of the self.
3. The fourth step in Edwards' defense of the objectivity of the new spiritual sense is that the redeemed's spiritual perceptions are veridical.
4. There is disagreement among scholars about whether Locke believed the corpuscular hypothesis cannot resolve the problem of cohesion.
5. Berkeley argues that material objects are not necessary to explain our ideas, and the best explanation for our consistent experiences with objects is not material objects but the weaknesses of the opponents' theories.
6. There were similar developments towards a theory of consciousness in England during the same time period as continental Europe.
7. Locke argues that it is impossible to know if a quality or idea has a necessary connection with a real essence that we cannot conceive.
8. Philonous claims that an idea cannot exist without being actually perceived.
9. Descartes and Locke held a realist position regarding external objects, while Berkeley and Hume challenged this view by arguing that it leads to skepticism.
The second axiom states that as long as an agent possibly intends an action, it is not able to uncommit to it. A doing (or an attempt to do) B is generated by a practical principle at time t if the agent does not change their mind. According to the narrower understanding of practical reasoning, it is an inferential process that modifies our beliefs, including our normative beliefs about what we ought to do. The adjustments in our intentions that result from such reflection are not themselves conclusions of reasoning. Once an agent has figured out what one ought to do, there is no further practical reasoning left to be done on this view. According to Donald Davidson in his 1963 paper, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," a reason is characterized as an attitude of an agent that can be cited to explain or justify an action. According to the Davidson/Anscombe thesis, the agent's act of moving his leg = his act of trying to move that leg. So, perhaps the act of trying to move the leg doesn't cause the act of moving after all, since they are just the same.
1. Euclid's Elements postulates are often referred to as 'postulates' in English.
2. The appendix contains a proof mentioned in the sentence.
3. Algebra is of philosophical interest due to its domain independence, affinity to formal logic, and duality in reasoning.
4. Geometrical knowledge involves theoretical knowledge and knowledge of the external world.
5. The Greeks referred to a mathematical proposition as 'diagramma'.
6. A proof conveyed through an image or diagram is called a "picture proof".
7. A proposition that examines the relationship between language and reality is known as a semantic proposition.
Suzan Stebbing contributed to the development of analytic philosophy by fostering critical engagement between different schools of thought and promoting critical reflection on the nature of analysis. Feminist social epistemology suggests that knowers are deeply dependent on one another in their epistemic activities and that their interactions play a crucial role in knowledge acquisition and justification processes. Alison Wylie proposes that objectivity should be understood as the degree to which knowledge claims conform to some standard set of epistemic virtues, and that feminist standpoint can improve objectivity by determining which epistemic virtues are relevant for a particular knowledge project. Kristie Dotson identifies two types of silencing practices: testimonial quieting and testimonial smothering. Jane Duran believes that naturalized epistemology is capable of including features valued by feminist standpoint epistemology due to its descriptive character and concern with context and details of knowing. Gender is a significant area of investigation for social epistemologists because it is a category of social relations that has shaped our knowledge practices and is implicated in systems of oppression, particularly against women.
The view that follows Adams 1981 claims that quantified propositions can be true at a possible world even if there are no corresponding singular propositions that could have been true at that world, requiring abandoning a general analysis of the truth of quantified propositions in terms of atomic propositions. According to the Fregean tradition, ontological commitment is connected to semantic value in that each plural term has some objects as its semantic value, just as each singular term has one object as its semantic value. Truths about objects other than the blobject correspond to them indirectly.
John Campbell argues for a relational view of experience to account for our demonstrative thoughts about mind-independent objects. Jackson's stance on qualia and the knowledge argument has evolved, and he now advocates for strong representationalism. Martin's argument against naive realism has a reverse causal stage. Epistemological idealism can lead to metaphysical idealism, but it's not a necessity.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into various topics such as ramsey, physics-Rpcc, questions, natural-properties, shared-agency, natural-language-ontology, social-procedures, necessary-sufficient, analytic-synthetic, ceteris-paribus, abduction, lakatos, logic-epistemic, logic-informal, thick-ethical-concepts, logic-belief-revision, logic-nonmonotonic, logic-temporal, ramsey, williams-dc, implicature, dialetheism, arrows-theorem, logic-dialogical, logic-conditionals, logic-combinatory, and habermas. Each question and answer pair provides information and insights into the respective philosophical topics.
The first question discusses the circularity in using the Boltzmann distribution to explain temperature, as it relies on the thermodynamic law connecting entropy and temperature. The second question focuses on the direction of time and its associated problems. The third question addresses the energy conservation properties of chaotic systems with self-similarity or noninteger dimension. The fourth question highlights the challenge of associating entropy with our ordinary concept of order in the entropic account of natural laws. The fifth question discusses the spontaneous movement from non-equilibrium to equilibrium as a time-asymmetric principle in thermodynamics. The sixth question mentions the descriptive parameters of material systems from the seventeenth century onward, which typically referred to geometric, dynamical, and thermal properties of matter. The last question debates whether the asymmetry of radiation phenomena is a fundamental causal asymmetry or due to asymmetry between initial and final conditions.
Robert Boyle's spiritual experience during a thunderstorm led him to renew his commitment to Christianity, which he upheld due to the inherent excellence of the religion. Charles Taylor calls the argument that new revelatory claims correct previous cognitive errors a "supersession argument." Rosenzweig's Star emphasizes human mortality, breaking down the "All" in philosophy into three fundamental kinds of beings. Fechner argues that the earth has a soul, regardless of the absence of organic functions, and started his academic career as a lecturer on physiology at the age of twenty-two. Fechner's perspective on nature shifted from viewing it as a mechanism to an organic whole after reading Lorenz Oken's Lehrbuch zur Naturphilosophie.
Gongsun Long was influenced by the Mohists, who argue for equal care for all, even beyond basic obligations, due to religious beliefs and the intention of Heaven. The speaker presents a hypothetical situation to argue that inclusion can replace exclusion. Mohism is a Chinese philosophical school that emphasizes impartiality, utility, and the concept of "all-under-heaven." Gongsun Long's main hypothesis is that language is a consecrated structure that denominates actualities.
1. States cannot voluntarily leave the UN Charter after joining it because it is generally understood not to be open to unilateral withdrawal, and consent to it is considered irrevocable.
2. The International Criminal Court is required to consider the views and concerns of victims in its proceedings when their personal interests are affected, in a manner that does not prejudice the rights of the accused to a fair trial.
3. A lack of motivation from those in power to implement a socialist plan could lead to the misuse of their power for selfish ends, undermining the effectiveness of socialist government.
4. If enforcement agencies are no longer able to function, the coerciveness of the law will quickly evaporate, regardless of the law's legitimacy.
5. Without justification based on some principle(s), merely adding offenses to the list of corruption does not provide a sufficient understanding of what constitutes corruption.
6. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg mandated the destruction of the National Socialist Party and its affiliated organizations, the dissolution of all Nazi institutions, and the prevention of any Nazi or military activity or propaganda.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, specifically discussing David Lewis's theories on counterparthood, rigid designators, and modality de re. The questions cover various categories such as 'david-lewis', 'problem-of-many', 'lewis-metaphysics', 'rigid-designators', 'metaphysics', and 'principia-mathematica'. The answers provide explanations and examples to illustrate Lewis's concepts and theories.
René Descartes is a philosopher and mathematician known for his statement "Cogito, ergo sum" and his method of skepticism. His method is a significant aspect of his philosophy and science. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes might relax his epistemic standards by settling for probabilistic arguments. The meditator can still accept the arguments in Arc 1 of the Meditations because the mind cannot but assent to a proposition when clearly and distinctly attending to it. Descartes regarded nonhuman animals as machines, devoid of mind and consciousness. He believes that reflecting on our ideas is crucial in logic. Descartes further elaborates on his Meditations on First Philosophy in the Second Replies.
1. In Confucianism, de is translated as moral virtue.
2. Xunzi uses the term 'xing' to refer to basic faculties, capacities, and desires that lead to harmful actions if not reflected upon and moderated.
3. Neo-Confucian ministers struggle to establish their own power base due to having no special commitments or loyalties to groups.
4. Confucius believes that when people's basic needs are met, they will gain knowledge of propriety, moderation, and understand the difference between honor and shame.
5. Chinese scholars are questioning whether Confucianism can be considered a religion.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into various topics such as ergodic hierarchy, nonwellfounded set theory, epistemology, visual thinking, computational complexity, continuity, axiom choice, chance and randomness, proof theory, mathematics constructive, and computability. Each question and answer pair provides a concise summary of the key points of the content.
1. The class of L-structures where the interpretation of the binary predicate symbol ≤ is a well-ordering corresponds to the class of models of the L(ω1,ω1) sentence σ = σ1 ∧ σ2, where σ1 is the usual L-sentence characterizing linear orderings.
2. The question of pluralism takes a non-skeptical stance toward ZFC and seeks axioms that solve the problem of selection at the level of second-order arithmetic and somewhat beyond in the hierarchy of statement complexity.
3. If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot determine whether all Σ̰12 sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable.
4. In set theory, there are two main categories of sentences: those similar to the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) and those similar to the Plank's Length Mathematical Conjecture (PM).
5. If we had a unique Ω-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the universe of sets, it would make for a strong case for new axioms completing the axioms of ZFC and large cardinal axioms.
6. The class of all cardinals is not a set, but a proper class in set theory.
7. A transitive set A is admissible if <A, ∈ | A> is a model of ZFC.
8. If Duplicator has a winning strategy in the pebble game described, where players can only use p numbered pebbles and must reuse them after they run out, it means that the two structures being compared agree for sentences which use at most p variables, regardless of how many times those variables occur.
Philo initially agreed with Clitomachus that Carneades' ability to maintain critical stances towards all beliefs represented a paradigm of self-conscious rationality. Pyrrho is considered the starting point of Pyrrhonism, but it is unclear to what extent he himself was a sceptic in the mold of the later Pyrrhonist tradition. Our knowledge of Arcesilaus' work is limited because he did not write any philosophical works himself, and his arguments were initially preserved by his students and in the work of his opponents. There are several reasons to doubt that Carneades straightforwardly believed that nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any impression after arguing for these conclusions.
Aristotle and ancient philosophers believe that nothing comes to be out of nothing. The logical consequence of D5 and D6 in a philosophical argument is that it is not possible for the one to not be, and therefore, the one is. Comprehensive accounts of Zeno and his arguments can be found in various sources. Aristotle holds that if something is at rest because something else has stopped moving, that thing must be moved by something, implying the need for an unmoved mover. The first premise in the argument for matter and form is justified by the thought that there is no generation ex nihilo, and in every instance of change, there are two factors present: matter and form. Aristotle claims that even if we cannot make absolute judgments, our ability to make comparative judgments presupposes some absolute standard, and therefore something truth-like is still being presupposed. Zeno argues that if every space is infinitely divisible, then any moving object must traverse an infinite number of smaller spaces to cover the distance, making local motion impossible. If one does not accept Zeno's argument that motion is illusory, they owe an account of what is wrong with his argument and must show why his reasons are not sufficient.
The document contains a collection of question-answer pairs on various topics in philosophy, including logical form, category mistakes, dynamic semantics, computational linguistics, anaphora, ambiguity, tense-aspect, and computational linguistics. Each question-answer pair is categorized and summarized in up to 2 sentences.
#### Summary:

1. Various types of pleasures might share a common characteristic of heightened sensory experience and emotional engagement, such as anticipation and release.
2. Desires may necessarily give rise to certain feelings of pleasure or displeasure, according to some philosophers.
3. Pleasure derived from fulfilling distinct rational inclinations comes from distinct knowledge and perception of harmony, while pleasure from confused bodily inclinations may lead to pain and suffering.
#### Summary:

1. Habermas associates authenticity claims with "ethical" discourse, where reasons for cogent arguments depend on individual life histories, traditions, and values. However, he recognizes some ethical questions that admit of universal consensus, such as choices of technologies affecting human nature.
2. The content of public reason may be too thin to settle important issues in a democratic system, as it might not align with what reasonable agents would primarily appeal to when settling fundamental political questions.
3. Goldman and Tuana suggest that open-mindedness and inquisitiveness are important qualities for citizens in a liberal society.
4. Combining the view of autonomy with the endorsement constraint in liberalism implies that autonomy is respected only when guiding values or principles in a society can be embraced by those governed by them.
Bridgman advocated operationalism, which defines concepts in terms of operations used to measure them, to clarify scientific concepts and eliminate ambiguity. Fleck does not believe science contains an objective picture of the world due to its constantly changing nature, but he uses the term "truth" in reference to scientific statements and emphasizes that truth is not subjective or relative. Staley and Galison agree that arguments are offered for the correctness of experimental results, but disagree on the nature of those arguments. Collins believes that the regress in evaluating scientific hypotheses and theories is broken by factors such as the career, social, and cognitive interests of the scientists, and the perceived utility for future work.
Parmenides believed in a single unchanging substance, Chrysippus influenced Stoicism, The Liar caused Philetus' death, Diodorus Cronus and Philo made contributions in logic and motion, Democritean fragments are found in Heinze 1892 and Isnardi Parente 1982, Sappho claimed greater insight on love than Socrates, Gershom Scholem's poetry collection is titled "In the Fullness of Time: Poems", and Anaxagoras influenced Pericles according to Plutarch.
The Analysis debate suggests modifying the concept of truth conduciveness to consider all relevant evidence. Transmission failure occurs when evidence for a proposition cannot be transmitted to certain elements of collateral information. A deductively valid argument has the power to resolve doubt about its conclusion. An alternative strategy for solving McKinsey paradox assumes a different presupposition of s's cognitive project. Young children cannot be justified in accepting their parents' testimony according to Local Reductionism. A preliminary suggestion for restricting necessary truths is that P entails* Q only if the fact that would make P true is at least a constituent of the fact that would make Q true. The complexity of relationships between evidence can lead to fallibility in responding appropriately to evidence. The proposed source of infallibility in foundational justification is a special kind of justification where the belief's ground or justification entails the truth of the belief.
1. Proponents of CCTM+RTM who embrace a physicalist outlook believe that mental computations are implemented by physical stuff, specifically the brain.
2. One possible solution to the Domain Integration Problem is that the language system has the capacity to play the role of content integrator in virtue of its capacity to transform conceptual representations that have been linguistically encoded.
3. Embodied cognition is often presented as a radical alternative to computationalism and typically argues that internal mental computation is not the key to understanding cognition.
4. Kosslyn argues that mental representations have spatial properties and tasks are accomplished via their examination and manipulation, while Pylyshyn argues that the same empirical facts can be explained using only discursive, propositional representations and cognitive processes defined over them.
5. Cummins concludes that in order to generate an unbounded number of distinct mental representations, the human brain must employ a syntactically and semantically combinatorial system of mental representation, similar to a language of thought (LOT).
6. Fodor claims that central systems are not modular.
Kant's energetic model of matter posits that heat is a symptom of molecular vibration, which depends on the energy-state of a body. The carrier of warmth and light is identified as the ether, or "fire-matter," which permeates the molecular interstices of bodies. Kant's account of hope has been applied and developed in recent philosophical works, addressing various aspects such as faith in the existence of God, political contexts, and practical education. Allison's critics might assume that he intends a stronger interpretation of Kant's claims due to evidence from Kant's texts. The broader aim of the PAO is to provide a corrected Kantianism that addresses inconsistencies in Kant's system. Kant's discussions of God could potentially be divided into two spheres: transcendental philosophy and metaphysics. The focus of Kant's comment on religious assent is on its moral significance rather than ontological commitment. Kant describes hope in relation to our interest in happiness in the Critique of Pure Reason. Kant famously presented a rational argument for belief in God as a "postulate of practical reason" in his work from 1788. Non-cognitivists can find support in Wittgenstein's characterization of religion as "a passionate commitment to a system of reference."
Descartes' account of clear and distinct perceptions, according to Astell, requires ideas to be clear in order to provide knowledge. Descartes characterizes the relationship between a substance's essence and its qualities or modes as one of reciprocal conceptual dependence. Descartes endorses clear and distinct conceivability as licensing the move from conceivability to possibility, as opposed to Hobbes's general conceivability. There is an issue with Descartes' laws of motion from a relationist perspective, particularly involving the fourth and fifth collision rules, due to the inconsistency in considering motion and rest as different intrinsic states of bodies.
Seevinck's (2004) criterion of holism states that it is impossible to infer global properties of a physical theory using only local resources. Bhattacharyya, Lee, and Wiseman take a supremum over all possible input states after pairwise comparing quantum mechanical distributions. QBists argue that quantum theory, from their perspective, faces no conceptual problems associated with measurement or non-locality. Adopting QBism seems to restrict one's application of quantum theory to anticipations of their own experiences, with no implications for those of anyone else.
1. Maryann Ayim shares Moulton's concern about aggressive expectations in philosophical arguing and reasoning in Euro-American culture.
2. No research has found differences between men and women in their ability to analyze and evaluate arguments according to critical thinking skills.
3. Standpoint theory is a heavily debated area of theorizing for feminist epistemologists, offering an argument for the grounding of epistemic perspective in one's social position.
4. Key figures in the development of evolutionary epistemology include Darwin, Spencer, James, Konrad Lorenz, Donald Campbell, Karl Popper, and Stephen Toulmin.
5. Rebecca Jordan-Young criticizes brain organization research as the dominant approach in sex differences in the brain research.
6. Most philosophers have not paid much attention to potential integration of evolutionary psychology into the broader interdisciplinary study of society and culture, but feminist philosophers have shown interest and offered critiques.
7. Cultural approaches to technology often align themselves with phenomenology or post-phenomenology, with philosophers like Don Ihde, Albert Borgmann, Peter-Paul Verbeek, and Evan Selinger being examples.
Summary:

* Some pluralists propose using the statistical idea of screening off to identify layers of allelic environments in the genic account.
* Dupré, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky argue for species pluralism due to the multifaceted nature of the organic world revealed by evolutionary theory.
* Kitcher argues that molecular genetics cannot reduce classical Mendelian genetics because molecular constituents do not capture the causal relations between Mendelian constituents and heritable traits.
* Nagel's account of reduction is considered unrealistic and inapplicable to actual science by many due to its strict logical requirements.
* Some philosophers argue that the concept of natural kinds should be eliminated in scientific classification due to its multifarious usage and lack of usefulness.
* Crick asserts that information flow in biological systems is one-way, from nucleic acid to nucleic acid or from nucleic acid to protein, and is impossible in the reverse direction.
1. Uniform resolution of generalized Curry paradoxes may simplify the process of addressing these paradoxes in a consistent manner.
2. Changing normative standards from Peano to ZFC+ when teaching arithmetic to children may require changes in teaching methods.
3. The Liar paradox is a central issue in the development of non-classical logics.
4. Formalizing the intuitive understanding of semantics and set theory can lead to inconsistencies.
5. Leitgeb 2008 provided a consistency proof for a probabilistic theory of truth with unrestricted T-schema using the Hahn-Banach Theorem.
6. Non-wellfoundedness and paradoxes related to self-reference and Russell’s paradox can be found in the entries on self-reference and Russell’s paradox.
7. Church, Kripke, and Myhill share the view that the axioms of reducibility in Russell's Theory of Types only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions while leaving intensional notions unaffected.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, specifically focusing on skepticism, moral responsibility, incompatibilism, and free will. The questions cover various aspects of these topics, including historical accounts, arguments, and objections. The answers provide concise explanations and key points for each question.
The Strong Continuity Thesis posits that our typical streams of consciousness are experientially connected through brief successive phases. A form of semantic externalism might make Davidson's transcendental argument against skepticism redundant. The externalist view of memory might receive intuitive support according to Tye in the given scenario. The Representation Problem is trying to explain how our mental symbols and words get connected to mind-independent objects. Externalism about mental content is the philosophical view that mental content is determined by factors outside the thinker's skin, such as causal relations to the environment.
#### Summary:

1. According to Holmes, tort law is primarily concerned with practical problem solving rather than moral judgments.
2. The quote distinguishes between enquiries into the existence of law and enquiries into whether the law conforms to an assumed standard.
3. The main issue at stake between legal moralists and proponents of public reason is whether legal justification should be steered towards citizens or towards moral truth.
4. Unilateral secession is secession without the consent of the state, while consensual secession is secession with the consent of the state.
5. Walzer suggests that it is permissible to violate moral rules in supreme emergency, but he is biased towards state actors in his discussion of this concept.
John Dewey criticized the common view of perception as passive and argued for an active process of experiencing and interpreting stimuli. He is associated with pragmatism, which he sometimes referred to as "experimentalism". Richard Rorty's philosophy is criticized for his account of knowledge as representation and his integration of Dewey, Hegel, and Darwin in a pragmatist synthesis of historicism and naturalism. Dewey argues that the process of understanding must have the same characteristics everywhere. John Dewey had a religious background and experience during his early adulthood. Needham's approach to the history of science in China has been criticized as anachronistic and culturally inappropriate. Being aware of the racist assumptions in Royce's work is important for anyone applying his philosophy to contemporary problems. Dewey's schematic pattern of inquiry outlines how exemplary cases of inquiry unfold, particularly in empirical sciences. Dewey suggests that we should see social facts practically, as serving to delimit a problem in a way that affords indication and test of proposed solutions. Jerome Bruner followed John Dewey in urging educators to get their students out into the local communities to explore various aspects of life experience. Ella Flagg Young was a lifelong educator and administrator in the Chicago school system before she became a professor at the University of Chicago and made significant contributions to Dewey's ideas.
1. Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Emma Goldman argued that women are made socially unequal to men by unpaid housework and mothering.
2. Women in classical American pragmatism used pragmatism to engage in social reform movements and brought added dimensions to the philosophy.
3. Feminist political philosophy is considered the paradigmatic branch of feminist philosophy as it focuses on understanding and improving collective life.
4. Edith Stein believed that married women could practice their religious vocation and that there is no dogma preventing women's ordination.
5. Grace Lee Boggs received her Ph.D. in philosophy from Bryn Mawr and her dissertation was on pragmatist George Herbert Mead's work.
Brentano argues that all mental phenomena have an intentional object within themselves. The first thesis regarding experiences is that beliefs have conceptual content, which is also applied to experiences. Searle argues that consciousness and intentionality are essential properties of mental states, biologically produced by our brains. Some philosophers argue that phenomenal character of experience is determined by causal environmental connections. Sriharsa raises an issue against the definition of knowledge involving awareness of a distinctive property X. If the being-of-that-ness is considered part of the nature of the relation R, it leads to the threat of idealism. The suggested solution for achieving unity in the mind is to postulate a primitive relation of co-consciousness.
1. In First-Order Logic (FOL), sentences with no free variables are not affected by variable assignments regarding satisfaction.
2. If there are no distinct objects with identical mass in any domain, the approximation sign (\dq{\approx}) would be considered a logical constant, and "\dq{\forall x (x \approx x)}" would be a logical truth.
3. The condition for interchangeability of sentences \(t \in \{ x: \phi x\}\) and \(\phi t\) is that no object in the domain satisfies \(\phi\) if and only if it does not satisfy \(\phi t\).
4. Substituting term \(t\) for variable \(x\) in statement \(A\) has no effect if \(x\) is not free in \(A\).
5. In a language without function symbols, metalanguage copies of predicate symbols can serve as unique identifiers for atomic formulas.
6. In Henkin's second style of language, one must ask what sets of assignments satisfy the formula 'uniformly' to achieve a compositional and fully abstract semantics.
7. The separation theorem states that if two IFL sentences of different vocabularies have no models in common, there exists a first-order sentence that every model of the first sentence satisfies, but the second sentence has no models in common with.
Putnam's Division of Linguistic Labor proposes that the referents of terms used by an individual can be fixed not by their own knowledge or beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain experts to whom they defer. If we find it intolerable that there are possible worlds that differ only in the identities of some of the individuals, then we must suppose that individuals have non-trivial individual essences. It is determinate that Omega does step out of the cabinet in situation (3). The description 'the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky' is not considered a rigid designator because its reference can change over time. There are examples of concrete objects that are considered abstract objects, such as impure sets, the Undergraduate Class of 2020, The Ethics Committee, and the object London in the Sherlock Holmes stories. In this philosophical context, rigidity does interesting epistemological and metaphysical work. A "natural kind" refers to a category of things in the world that have an essential nature that determines their identity and behavior. An example of two terms where one is more specific than the other but does not stand in the relationship of a determinate to its determinable is “yellow” and “yellow or angry”. When Brueckner refers to "Putnamian non-disquotational truth conditions", he is referring to the idea that the truth of the statement "I am a BIV" cannot be determined simply by looking at the statement itself, but rather depends on some external factors that are not explicitly mentioned in the statement.
1. A philosophy professor might explain the word "floor" to an extraterrestrial being through demonstrative methods such as leading them from floor to floor, pointing at the floor, stamping on it, and repeatedly saying the word "floor".
2. Examining pseudo-questions in philosophy can help improve our understanding of genuine philosophical questions by allowing us to distinguish them from spurious look-alikes, thereby honing our diagnostic tools.
3. Some philosophers have previously assumed that life satisfaction surveys are unstable and prone to order effects, believing that the correlation between global life satisfaction and specific aspects of life depends on the order in which the questions are asked.
4. Shweder, Turiel, and Much believe that the meaning of "morality" is something discovered, not stipulated.
5. Considering contrasting cases can inspire reflection about a particular question or issue.
6. Philosophers have different interpretations of evidence in an Evidentialist theory of ethics, with some defining it in terms of demonstrative proof, others in terms of objective and/or subjective probability, and still others in terms of any factor that influences belief.
Existentialism emphasizes human freedom and the power of human will. Authenticity refers to engaging in one's projects as one's own. Sartre's critique of reflection forms the basis of his argument for pre-reflective consciousness. Camus's solution to the problem of suicide is to embrace life fully with consciousness. Heidegger saw traditional Christianity as making authentic existence more difficult.
Kant argues that Spinoza conflates the notion of a being that is not grounded in or caused by anything more fundamental with the notion of a being that does not inhere in anything more fundamental in his definition of substance. Kant claims that propositions of "pure natural science" exist in a footnote according to my understanding. In his rejection of transcendental idealism, Strawson has abandoned much of Kant's talk of mechanisms of synthesis in the generation of proper experience, as well as Kant's arguments about space and time, geometry, and the argument from Antinomies that supports transcendental realism leading to contradictions. A 'fact of reason' is the consciousness of the fundamental law that cannot be deduced from antecedent data of reason. It is something that is imposed upon us by practical reason and the moral law. The three basic cognitive faculties that Kant derives from his two general aspects of the mind are sensibility, understanding, and reason (or the 'intellect' more broadly). This view is known as idealism, and it is the belief that a priori laws of human knowledge determine what counts as an object for us. This view holds that our minds play an active role in shaping our understanding of reality, rather than simply passively receiving information from the external world. The analytic method is a reasoning strategy that traces a given body of cognition, such as mathematics, to its origin or sources in the mind. The synthetic method, on the other hand, aims to derive real cognition directly from such original cognitive sources, which are first explicated independently of any particular body of cognition that the powers might ultimately produce. Kant adopts the former method in his Prolegomena and the latter method in the Critique of Pure Reason when discussing the possibility of pure mathematics. The principle that an 'ought' cannot be derived from an 'is' is known as Hume's Guillotine or Hume's Law. Kant claims that we will our own happiness as an end according to natural necessity because it is necessary for distinguishing assertoric from problematic imperatives and arguing for the imperfect duty of helping others. Additionally, he appears to rely on this claim in each of his examples of moral evaluation, as maxims in pursuit of happiness are the typical object of such evaluations. The conclusions in Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic are intended to follow from the arguments within the Metaphysical Exposition and the Transcendental Exposition. They are not given any additional argumentative support, and are meant to be entailed by the view that the representation of space is an a priori intuition. The first two conclusions labeled "a" and "b" are particularly robust, with the first one being quite startling. An "exposition" is a clear representation of what belongs to a concept, and it is considered metaphysical if it contains what the concept presents as a priori given. It is different from a definition and focuses primarily on our representation of a concept rather than the concept itself.
1. Economic Justice: Three developments around utilitarian social welfare functions are the analysis of their properties, application to other domains, and development of computational tools.
2. Legal-Econ Analysis: Cost-benefit analysis tries to fulfill the Kaldor-Hicks criterion by ensuring a Pareto preferred distribution of goods.
3. Economics: Many economists assume preferences align with welfare, given self-interest and good judgment.
4. Methodological Individualism: Elster assumes rational choice theory follows from methodological individualism.
5. Preferences: The standard discounted utility model doesn't fully represent human behavior, but can be addressed with a bifactorial model or hyperbolic discounting.
6. Public Goods: The Groves-Clarke mechanism is expensive but avoids social waste compared to alternative mechanisms.
7. Preferences: Numerical representation of preferences has limitations, as not all preferences can be represented numerically.
#### Summary:

* Braun argues that the difference in implicature-potential between unembedded sentences is the source of the difference in intuitions regarding the truth-value of typical utterances.
* The CDQ account suggests that the illusion of universal force for the indefinite in a statement is the result of the interaction of the semantics of the conditional, the indefinite, and the context dependent quantifier "she".
* An utterance of (1) asserts that Lois has a belief whose content is captured by the ascriber's utterance of the sentence 'Superman is strong'.
* Ross calls linguistic utterances that represent states of affairs in the world "assertions".
1. Henri Poincaré gave a speech at the 1900 International Congress of Physics in Paris addressing the bankruptcy-of-science debate and its history-fed pessimism.
2. Field explains the utility of mathematics in science as merely pragmatic - mathematics makes calculation and statement of various theories much simpler.
3. Einstein saw realism not as a philosophical doctrine about the interpretation of scientific theories or the semantics of theoretical terms, but rather as a physical postulate.
Scheler argues that when people share an attitude, it is not a combination of individual intentionality with reciprocal awareness, but rather a numerically identical state shared by many minds. Tuomela responds to the charge of circularity in his analysis of we-intentions by arguing that the collectivity consists in the participants' having we-intentions, which depends on their satisfaction of the collectivity condition. Tollefsen's interpretationist account establishes that groups can be subjects of intentional states by focusing on the rational unity certain groups, such as organizations, are capable of displaying. Tuomela and Miller propose that there is an overlooked class of attitudes called "we-attitudes," while Searle considers these we-attitudes to be distinct primitive mental states. The three components of intentional attitudes that have been suggested as the locus of collectivity in collective intentionality are content, mode, and subject.
#### Summary:

1. Socially conservative equity feminists believe the state should discourage disfavored ways of life through noncoercive means, but not force traditional family forms.
2. Some feminists worry that considering abortion as a right related to body ownership and control could make it difficult to question abortions performed on grounds of sex selection or trivial reasons.
3. Andrea Nicki sees anger and aggression as morally valuable and liberating expressions for some neurodiverse people, particularly emotionally abused individuals.
1. In Conway's Game of Life, a glider is a pattern that remains unchanged through generations of development.
2. The observed direction of time is referred to as "the arrow of time".
3. In Tumulka (2006c: 350), restating and reinforcing an idea in a different publication is referred to as a conclusion being "rephrased and reinforced."
4. The Principal Principle can also be referred to as a deference principle in general terms.
5. The title of the table that outlines the general aspects of each view's analysis of scientific theories is "General aspects of each view’s analysis of the structure of scientific theories."
6. "Name-using practice" is another term used with the same goal in mind as "uniquely denoting name", but with a greater reluctance to embrace genuine homonymy.
7. Mathematical induction is also known as "infinite descent" when it is used in the context of a series of logical deductions based on an initial case and a general principle.
Popper's initial proposal for measuring truthlikeness has issues with double counting and trivialization. Every test of a theory must ultimately accept basic statements. Popper distinguishes between conditional and unconditional scientific prophecies, arguing that ad hoc hypotheses reduce testability. Ronald Fisher criticizes measuring scientific evidence in terms of subjective probability, and the ease of accommodation can vary depending on the specifics of each situation.
Keightley justified his question about Chinese identity to understand what makes the Chinese Chinese. Tasan examined Chungyong kangŭibo to question the relationship between the "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate" and original Confucian ideas, noting that it was not found in original Confucianism. Han believed that the operation of the human mind is dependent on ki, both original and corrupted.
Weyl's unified field theory was driven by mathematical considerations rather than physical ones, which led him to hold on to his gauge theory despite compelling empirical arguments against it. The Galilean transformations must be replaced by the Lorentz transformations in order to be consistent with the speed of light's constancy. Eddington's objective in his theory of the affine field was to consolidate the known field laws and simplify the scheme, rather than seeking unknown laws as befits a unified field theory. Weyl published his three important papers on adapting Dirac's theory of the special relativistic electron to general relativity and developing the tetrad or Vierbein formalism in 1929. The kinematic principle of relative motion is by itself without any content unless an additional physical causal assumption is made. The relativity principle first appears as "Law 3" in Newton's work titled "De motu sphæricorum corporum in fluidis", published in 1684. Despite absolute accelerations being in 1-1 correlation with patterns of spacetime interval relations, they cannot be eliminated in favor of merely relative motions. Helmholtz and Lie require homogeneity and isotropy for physical space, which are valid only in a matter-empty universe from a general Riemannian standpoint. Michelson and Morley could have assumed contraction in determining the length of the arms of their interferometer with no practical impact on their results.
Craig Carr challenges the idea that coercion is antithetical to freedom by arguing that some instances of coercion involve making choices. James Griffin argues that consequentialist impartiality is incompatible with prudential values that involve partial commitments. Karen Jones criticizes Potter's virtue theory of trustworthiness for not accounting for situations where being untrustworthy is required. Sherman's Aristotle's account of friendship raises concerns about autonomy as it may merge the interests and agency of two friends. A participatory idea suggests that consuming wrongfully-produced goods is wrong because it constitutes cooperation with or participation in wrongdoing. One criticism against the contractual view regarding family morality is that it conflicts with common-sense intuitions of unchosen special duties between family members.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into logic-inductive, confirmation, legal-probabilism, statistics, logic-inductive, epistemology-bayesian, formal-epistemology, and statistics. The questions cover various topics such as the relationship between the Quality of Instantiation (QI) of a sequence of outcomes and the QI of individual outcomes, the role of the likelihood ratio in Bayes' theorem, the influence of the prior probability over hypotheses in Bayesian analysis, and the significance of De Finetti's representation theorem in the context of subjectivist prior over hypotheses.
1. Haíresis in neo-Pyrrhonism refers to a skeptical view of the world that varies between individuals.
2. Pierre Bayle may distance himself from certain arguments in his text to offer a reductio ad absurdum of Catholic fideism based on philosophical skepticism.
3. Porchat has made a significant contribution to the study of Cartesian skepticism in Brazil.
4. Luiz Henrique de Araújo Dutra's skeptical position is called "alethic skepticism".
5. Philo's new conception of rationality implies that it is compatible with outright error.
6. The Condemnation of 1277 emphasized God's omnipotence, leading to increased skeptical doubt in medieval discussions.
1. In the literature on logic and games, the three phases of activities related to play are before, during, and after the game.
2. The dominant model of immune cognition understands the immune response as involving perception and reaction, construing immunity as an information-processing faculty.
3. According to Smith (1985), programs can be seen as related to the outside world through models of empirical systems.
4. In structuralist computational models of analogy, the goodness of an analogical argument is based on the goodness of the associated analogy mapping.
5. Predictive coding efficiently transmits image data by focusing coding resources on points of large change or unexpected variation.
1. Alan Goldman argues against affirmative action, suggesting jobs and educational opportunities should go to the most qualified, with exceptions for those specifically victimized by racial discrimination.
2. De facto residential segregation in US schools leads to significant consequences for poor and minority students' educational opportunities, as they are disproportionately educated in lower-performing schools compared to their white and more advantaged peers.
3. The ideal of equality of opportunity is controversial due to different interpretations and disagreements about its moral acceptability and enforcement as requirements of justice.
4. Affirmative action with disparate impact restrictions can serve as a cost-effective means to address and prevent disparate treatment that might otherwise evade legal constraints, increasing the extent to which the ideal of careers open to talents is achieved.
5. The final requirement for implementing equality of opportunity beyond legal enactments is that purchasers of goods and services should be responsive only to the price and quality of the goods, not the ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the maker or seller.
6. The principle of equality requires treating all individuals with equal respect and concern in the distribution of goods and opportunities.
7. The justification of a candidate conception of equality of opportunity must be sought in the context of the full theory of justice it is a part of, as formal and substantive equality of opportunity norms are proposed as components of a moral theory of justified social inequality.
1. Williamson's counterfactual theory states that a counterfactual is true at a possible world if and only if its antecedent is true at that world, and the truth value of a counterfactual does not depend on its consequent being true at the actual world.
2. Gibbard's example of contingent identity involves a statue and the clay from which it is composed, illustrating that their identity is contingent if the clay could have been destroyed while the statue remained intact.
3. Mandelkern et al, 2017 propose to take as basic a notion of 'practically available actions' and develop a semantics for agentive modality, with conditionals linking volitions to actions playing an essential role.
4. The next topic to be discussed after evaluating the validity of an argument that demonstrates the interdependence of identity's various topics is the analysis of modal predication, specifically whether it should be analyzed in terms of "identity across possible worlds" or in terms of Lewisian counterpart theory.
5. Hale relies on a Kripke-style deduction model for a posteriori knowledge of essence.
6. Applying transworld identity characterization of de re modal statements due to the absence of non-trivial individual essences may result in the generation of bare identities, which can be problematic, as illustrated by arguments such as Chisholm’s Paradox or Forbes’s reduplication argument.
7. Schaffer (2009) suggests that one could provide an introduction to the concept of ground through an ostensive definition, using examples of dependence claims or pairs of objects that instantiate the grounding relation.
8. One way to incorporate literally true non-modal propositions into a modal fiction is by including an "encyclopedia" in the fiction as Rosen does, which would provide a rich source of content about the actual world.
9. Geach uses the term "substantival" to describe the kinds of term that can be used in his claim about relative identity, which coincides with sortals in many cases but is not exactly the same.
10. In the sixth section of the text, the focus is on formal accounts of properties and their applications in natural language semantics and the foundations of mathematics, providing additional motivations for an ontological commitment to properties.
11. McDaniel proposes that for a property to be "fundamental," i.e. natural, is for there to be a prima facie obligation to form true beliefs about it. He uses a theory of propositions as structured entities to address the challenge that naturalness applies also to properties and relations, not just beliefs.
Hartley and Hales collaborated to find a chemical agent for dissolving bladder stones. Lavoisier's system emphasizes the importance of explaining the elemental basis of compounds. The law of universal gravitation states that the force of attraction between two bodies is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton synthesized the work of major figures in the natural sciences into the law of universal gravitation. Newton's views on physicalism were different from Democritus', as Newton believed in the existence of forces such as gravity. Some French philosophes proposed measures to overcome issues with Cheselden's account of cataract operations.
Locke distinguishes natural good from moral good based on the context of pleasures and pains, with moral good arising from conformity to moral dictates. Goldman and Tuana suggest open-mindedness and inquisitiveness are important qualities for citizens in a liberal society. MacIntyre criticizes modern moral discourse for lacking a conception of achieving the Good in community. Kant differentiates right and virtue by focusing on outer freedom and inner freedom/mastery over passions, respectively.
Summary:

* Morphogenesis is the series of processes involving cell translocation, aggregation, and tissue formation.
* Donna Haraway proposed organicism as a new Kuhnian paradigm in embryology in the first half of the twentieth century, which accounted for regulatory development without resorting to vitalism.
* Roux concluded that he had confirmed the mosaic hypothesis based on his experiment with frog eggs.
Functionalists typically try to explain away, modify, or downplay intuitions that challenge their theory. The Best Test Theory (BTT) addresses brain interventions by noting their rarity, limiting causal efficiency to natural kinds, and proposing that interventions may not trigger specific mental representations. Richard Samuels proposes that psychological explanations must apply to the whole organism. The focus of discussion in relation to mirroring processes is disgust mirroring, with conditions including unconsciousness, automatism, stimulus-driven nature, and satisfying the PROC condition. Burge criticizes standard teleosemantics for attributing representational states to simple organisms without explanatory value.
1. When making surrogate decisions for an adult with no decisional capacity, the best interest standard is applied.
2. A variation of the Trolley problem is introduced by considering a scenario.
3. Two scenarios are compared to make a rational judgment about one's own death: the overall goodness of life if it continues and the overall goodness of life if it ends.
4. Respecting a person's interest in following their own convictions at the end of life is crucial to preserving their general right to make intimate and personal choices.
5. The distinction between passive and active euthanasia might be unclear and unhelpful due to pragmatic considerations and the difficulty in maintaining a clear separation between the two.
Brouwer's first strong counterexample was published in 1928. The theory \({T}\) was developed by Gödel to axiomatize primitive recursive functionals of finite type and was arrived at by 1941. A full bibliography of Brouwer's writings can be found in an unspecified source. Frege's Nachlass and Schröder's papers were lost during the bomb attacks on Münster in 1945, but most of the typewritten copies Scholz had made were saved. The system KF was developed by Solomon Feferman and first published under the label Ref(PA) in 1991. Weak Kripke's Schema (WKP) is a principle that Kripke preferred in his interpretation of Brouwer's theory of the creating subject, but it still conflicts with strong continuous choice. The ideas of the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution method were first presented by Hilbert in his Hamburg lecture in 1921 (1922).
Thomas Hobbes applied geometrical principles in natural philosophy to provide causes or reasons for phenomena, while Francis Bacon preferred the inductive method and did not reject mathematics in science. Nova Atlantis is seen as an intermediate position between Bacon's theory of induction and his speculative philosophy.
1. Nyāya's extrinsicality view states that the psychological process involved in the certification of a cognition is apperception (anuvyavasāya), which is a second-level cognition that has another cognition as its object without being self-aware.
2. In Nyāya's account of auditory perception of an utterance, 'speaker's intention' is appealed to in cases where there is ambiguity in the words used in the utterance.
3. The standard Nyāya view on there being six types of sense-object relations that form the basis of perceptual experiences is attributed to Uddyotakara in The Manual of Reason (TS 48).
4. The Buddhist logic system presented by Paek is called four-cornered logic (catuṣkoṭi).
5. Dignāga argues that perception is radically and essentially separated from conception because he believes that only perception can provide an empirical foundation and a neutral ground for ascertaining the nature of particulars (svalakṣaṇas).
1. Legislatures can have a collective intention even if individual legislators' intentions may not be aligned, focusing on the legislature as an organized body rather than individual intentions.
2. Interpretation has a dualistic nature, involving both capturing existing law content and supplementing/modifying the law, playing a role in both senses of legal reasoning.
3. Precedents can be understood as laying down rules, applying underlying principles, or based on the balance of reasons.
4. The "bilateral nature" of private litigation is a feature of adjudication generally, not unique to private law, and its explanation should be based on something fundamental to adjudication.
5. Some legal theorists argue that law and adjudication are distinct concepts with separate answers, allowing judges discretion to consider extra-legal factors or modify existing law.
6. Dufour (1980) is a recommended source for further reading on complex issues related to this topic.
7. One source of complexity when dealing with mixed quotation is determining the exact scope of what to include.
Varner tentatively concludes that the boundary between pain-conscious organisms and those not capable of feeling pain consciously is between vertebrates and invertebrates. Dualists and property dualists who reject a physicalist ontology of consciousness must develop theories that articulate the specific non-physical features of reality related to consciousness. Defining protophenomenal properties as properties that give rise to consciousness is too broad and includes properties that constitute consciousness in non-fundamental ways. Non-reductive physicalists view mental properties as not physical but strongly dependent on the physical. The disagreement between eliminativists and derivativists about standing states in the context of intentionality lies in whether dispositional states can be considered as intentional states. Rejecting epiphenomenalism and maintaining that consciousness has effects on behavior allows for the possibility of knowing if a member of another taxonomic group has conscious states.
1. The text mentions other significant uses of visual representations in mathematics, but it does not specify what they are.
2. Future research on Euler diagrams should focus on balancing expressive power and visual clarity, and developing other efficient non-sentential representational systems.
3. Diagrams are helpful in proving certain lemmas about permutations by visualizing the setup and suggesting proof strategies.
4. The line in Venn-II diagrams allows for the connection of diagrams and the expression of disjunctive information between universal and existential statements.
5. Sensory experience can play an evidential role in acquiring mathematical knowledge beyond a merely enabling role, challenging the traditional view of mathematics as an exclusively a priori science.
In the first question, the three kinds of meaning-rules (or sense-rules) according to radical conventionalism are axiomatic rules, deductive rules, and empirical rules. In the second question, on Lewis's theory, when there are equally natural candidates to be the denotation of a term and each of them is consistent with our dispositions to use the term, then the denotation of the term is simply indeterminate between those candidates. In the third question, Inferentialism is a theory of semantics, both of formal logic and natural language usage. In the fourth question, a suggested approach for understanding different types of classical semantic theories is to start with another type of theory, namely a theory of reference.
Martha Nussbaum argues that domestic democratic endorsement is a condition of international law's legitimacy. Berlin differentiated between two forms of 'political realism': one that perceives reality without emotional distortions and another that scorns moral ideals and embraces dubious means. Schmitt claims that liberalism is unable to provide substantive markers of identity and constitute political community. Berlin's work aligned with liberalism and normative political theory but remained difficult to assimilate to postmodernism and multiculturalism. Robert Paul Wolff claimed Kantian inspiration for his philosophical anarchist views, but Kant himself was not an anarchist. Thomas Christiano expresses scepticism about the possibility of realizing genuine democracy at the global level. Emanuela Ceva characterizes conscientious objection as a form of political participation.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, specifically related to molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype, genomics, biology developmental, innate-acquired, and biology experiment. The answers provide key points and definitions related to these categories, such as the classical mode of explanatory reasoning in genetics, the definition of a gene according to Waters (2000), Johannsen's genotype-conception of heredity, the concept of actual difference makers in a population, the launch of the Human Genome Project, alternative perspectives on genes and their role in development, the term "i-properties" used by Mameli and Bateson, and the key figures in early 20th century genetic schools.
Morriston argues that there will be infinitely many distinct praises said because there will be no future time at which all have been said, and each distinct praise will be said at a different time. Theology Without Walls (TWW) draws on the diversity of models to understand the nature of a globally shared ultimate. The Inventory refers to a list of six disadvantages that Alston discusses in relation to discerning whether there are pointless evils from the fact of inscrutable evils. Hunt criticizes Fischer's "boot-strapping" account of divine foreknowledge as circular and incapable of supporting exhaustive foreknowledge. Van Inwagen suggests interpreting texts about God creating everything in a restricted manner to avoid asserting impossible propositions. William Lane Craig has developed an argument about the world being conditioned by the values of fundamental constants.
1. Information is defined as useful data, instructions, or meaningful message content that can be processed through computer technologies.
2. Crystal balls might be used as tools for observing past or future events, similar to a security monitor that displays footage from a different point in time.
3. Tracing back the fault in software testing after detecting miscomputations is done to provide an explanation before proceeding to the debugging phase.
4. The development of physics in the last third of the 20th century has led to the diminished serviceability of the concept of definite stable things.
5. The relationship between information theory and physics has improved prospects for a unified theory of information compared to the beginning of the twenty-first century.
6. The main goal of the KDD field is to develop methods and techniques for making sense of data by mapping low-level data into more compact, abstract, or useful forms.
Laozi suggests non-linguistic introspection as an alternative to linguistic comprehension to preserve naturalness. Nonaction implies a critique of societal values as ideologically driven. Nonaction in Daoist ethics ensures personal fulfillment and sociopolitical order, depicting a pristine natural and sociopolitical order.
Feinberg's harm principle only considers harms produced by morally indefensible conduct as a reason for legal coercion. The principle of double effect does not permit acts that cause certain kinds of harm if those harms were brought about as part of the agent's means to realizing the good end. The discrimination principle in war functions as a morally grounded rule of thumb that draws a stark contrast between intended and unintended killing. Offense is considered controversial in Mill's harm principle because it goes beyond his original position. The text differentiates between two types of dignity as "rarefied" human dignity and common dignity.
1. Some biology experiments may be given a special epistemic status in textbooks due to their illustrative value, but this does not necessarily imply exceptional evidential force.
2. Idealization in scientific practices can involve knowingly ignoring variations in properties or excluding particular values for variables for descriptive and explanatory purposes.
3. Developmental stages may be constructed in a way that ignores certain types of variation due to the desire to reduce variation and the selection of model organisms with less plasticity.
4. Deplazes' fifth category of synthetic biology focuses on the development and practical implementation of computer simulations.
Foucault critiques the view on sexuality in the 1960s and 1970s, Lyotard claims that trying to control and prefigure future events is an attempt to escape time, Lamarque claims that the reading practices of literary critics and historians involve different normative practices, Henry claims that the dominating feature of contemporary culture is the triumph of Galilean science and its technological developments, Lyotard never argued that all was socially constructed or that all language games had equal validity, and Bourdieu (1972) claims that social practice is generated by a "habitus," which is a mentally internalized system of discrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions.
Oresme's theory of motion is called the condicio-theory of accidents, which is an application of his more general theory of accidents to the problem of motion. Aristotle does not explicitly address the issue of absolute versus relative quantities of motion in his physics. Kilvington examines the problem of motion from two perspectives: with regard to its causes and with regard to its effects. Heytesbury focuses on establishing the rules for the “measurement” of speed in local motion, one of the continuous changes enumerated by Aristotle. Leibniz's resolution for the tension between the fundamental role of force/virtus and its association with Aristotelian form in his theory of mechanics is to require that while considerations of force must determine the form of the laws of motion, the laws themselves should be such that one cannot determine the value of the force (and hence true speed).
1. In model theory, the notation \(T \vDash \phi\) is used to express that the sentence 'φ' is a logical consequence of the theory T in the language L.
2. In Prior's Peircean semantics, the strong future operator \(G\) represents "it will necessarily always be the case that" and captures possibility and necessity regarding the future without referring to any actual future or notion of plain future truth.
3. RA1 states that announcements are truthful, while RA5 specifies the epistemic-state-transforming properties of the announcement operator by stating that an agent knows that a certain formula is true after an announcement iff the announced formula implies that the agent knows that the formula will be true after the announcement in all states where the announced formula is true.
4. In epistemic modal logic, the symbol \(K \phi\) represents that \(\phi\) is known to be true, or at least follows from what is known to be true.
5. In the justification analog of \({\textsf{K4}}\), the unary operator '!' is added to the term language to map justifications to justifications. If \(t\) is a justification for \(X\), then \(!t\) is a justification for \(t{:}X\).
6. In the first formalization of the Red Barn Example, the modality used for belief is a basic modal logic where \(\Box\) is interpreted as the 'belief' modality.
1. Bodin's concept of sovereignty is often misinterpreted as absolutism, but his ideas should be understood in the context of his historical period.
2. The Machiavellian prince does not acquire power through pre-existing structures of legitimation, dynastic inheritance, or popular support.
3. Rousseau rejects the idea of individual rights as a check on the sovereign's power, believing that such rights are a matter of sovereign competence and decision.
4. Poulain argues that fear is introduced as a consequence of some men taking advantage of their strength and leisure to subjugate others.
5. Hobbes assumes that people use seemingly impersonal terms like ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to stand for their own personal preferences when making evaluative judgments.
6. Thomas Paine's Agrarian Justice proposes a principled defense for welfare provision, based on the idea of original equality of man and the equal right to subsistence from the earth.
7. Kant believes that the principle of "like for like" should be used as the basis for determining specific judgments of punishment in retributivist theory.
8. Different interpretations attempt to reconcile the apparent contradiction between Machiavelli's Discorsi and Il Principe by suggesting that one represents his genuine views and the other is a satire or an attempt to regain his position in Florentine government.
9. The full development of social contract theory occurred in the seventeenth century, with Thomas Hobbes and John Locke being its main contributors.
10. Thomas Hobbes considered the Leviathan as the sovereign entity that reigned supreme and was above the law, established by the people through a contract in which they transferred all of their rights.
1. MPS for Nietzsche relies on three descriptive theses about human agency found in BGE 32; GM I:13; TI VI; EH III:5; and EH IV:8.
2. Nietzsche describes the spirit of the age as torn between perversity and brutality, unnaturalness and mere nature, and superstition and moral unbelief.
3. Nietzsche claims that every action is unknowable, as stated in Daybreak and other works such as The Gay Science and The Will to Power.
4. Nietzsche credits Wagner's operas with bringing back the synthesis of Apollonian and Dionysian elements in tragedy.
5. Nietzsche understood conceptual analysis as a process of historical inquiry that separates the distinct meanings that have been joined together through episode after episode of reinterpreting one and the same set of phenomena.
6. Nietzsche names the faith that all is redeemed and affirmed in the whole "Dionysus."
7. According to The Gay Science, Nietzsche argues that by far the greatest part of our spirit's activity remains unconscious and unfelt.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized by topics such as ibn-bajja, al-farabi-psych, al-ghazali, al-kindi, ibn-kammuna, arabic-islamic-causation, al-farabi-psych, al-ghazali, abu-bakr-al-razi, ibn-sina-metaphysics, and suhrawardi. The questions cover various philosophical views, including the relationship between matter and form, the role of intuition in epistemology, the active intellect in cosmology, and the criticism of traditional Sunni ethics. The answers provide concise explanations of these philosophical views and concepts.
1. The Sāṃkhya scheme of mental and physical elements is similar to the Buddhist Abhidharma scheme.
2. Sarvāstivādins are also known as Vaibhāṣikas due to their close adherence to The Great Commentary.
3. Some scholars use "Mainstream Buddhism" to refer to Buddhist lineages that held Sainthood as their primary spiritual aspiration, besides Theravāda.
4. Gautama, who became the Buddha, lived to be 80 years old according to traditional accounts.
5. The Kathā-vatthu aims to show the inconsistency of various propositions that are at odds with the views of the Sthaviravādins.
6. Sanskrit grammarians believed vernacular languages were religiously inferior due to their belief in the divine nature of Sanskrit and its religious value.
7. Jayarāśi viewed himself as belonging to the Lokāyata tradition based on his frequent quotations of Bṛhaspati, references to Bṛhaspati with reverence, and his alignment with the worldly path.
Antoine Arnauld initially studied law but later switched to theology. Dante was a poet who used his work to promote public discourse. Campanella's works, The City of the Sun and political aphorisms, were written in Italian while he was imprisoned. Dante's work, The Convivio, provides a comprehensive explanation of his philosophical ideas. Campanella was imprisoned in Stilo due to a conspiracy against the Spanish.
1. The term "strongly represent" can be confused with other terms like "represent", "numeralwise express", "bi-numerate", "define", or "strongly define".
2. Gödel aimed to prove the consistency of analysis using only arithmetic resources, which led him to discover his incompleteness theorem.
3. Tymoczko claims that computer proofs are not surveyable by human mathematicians, unlike traditional proofs.
4. Deriving the T-equivalences along with the assumption that formula F is inconsistent would give an explicit contradiction.
5. In Leonard 1930: 187ff., the option endorsed regarding defining 'P' in terms of '+i' was to treat '+i' as a primitive for i=3.
6. The mathematical fictionalist proposes to express the conservativeness of mathematics in the object-language by introducing a primitive notion of logical consistency (◊A) and using a schema that relates the axioms of a mathematical theory (M1, …, Mn) to sentences (B) that have been restricted to non-mathematical entities (B*).
1. Intention is a way of being in progress, not a mental state itself, making it challenging to relate to the mental state of belief.
2. Self-consciousness and awareness of others can be understood in two ways: self-consciousness requires awareness of others, or awareness of others requires self-consciousness.
3. Floridi's informational theory of personal identity challenges the distinction between online and offline identities, suggesting no clear boundary between the two.
4. In Sellars' analysis of norms, intention is a thought that motivates one to realize its content, while volition is an intention that has come to fruition.
5. The objection against the idea that mental capacity can vary according to external circumstances is that it is counterintuitive and goes against our intuition.
6. The "direction of fit" distinction between belief and desire is relevant to the Humean theory of motivation, as belief states cannot entail desire states due to their incompatible directions of fit.
7. An 'alief' is a mental state that involves holding beliefs, desires, and actions that are not in alignment with one's explicit beliefs, according to Gendler.
Searle's Chinese Room Argument significantly damaged Functionalism, which was then the dominant theory in philosophy of mind. The argument posed a strong challenge to the idea that computers could have mental states if Functionalism were correct, leading many to argue that the theory has never fully recovered from Searle's critique.

The first stage of the argument that Martin proposes against naive realism is the reverse causal argument.

Gordon suggests that one can make self-ascriptions of belief without introspection in a simulationist framework by imagining being the other person (in this case, Tom) and forming beliefs in the context of the simulation, which then results in the formation of the belief that (3). This allows for self-ascription without relying on introspection.

David Austin raises objections against Lewis and Chisholm's views on belief by presenting detailed and putative counterexamples that focus on the descriptivist aspect of their theories. According to Austin, both Lewis and Chisholm hold that an agent's belief about an object other than herself involves grasping a property that descriptively determines that object, and Austin challenges this descriptivist stance.

Williamson's method of counterfactual evaluation potentially faces the issue of circularity in his epistemology of modality, as it may rely on pre-existing knowledge of constitutive facts regarding the essence of objects, which are understood to be modal in nature (Boghossian 2011; Tahko 2012; Roca-Royes 2011b).

Hauser accuses Searle of Cartesian bias in his inference from "it seems to me quite obvious that I understand nothing" to the conclusion that he really understands nothing. Hauser suggests that Searle may be mistaken and may actually understand Chinese unconsciously.
1. Some theorists argue that resemblance theories of depiction cannot explain how pictures represent fictional individuals or kinds of objects without resembling any particular instances.
2. A less than fully realist account of metaphysical explanation might depend on psychological factors such as the cognitive sophistication of its recipients.
3. The puzzle is whether non-philosophers are mistaken in their understanding of manipulability's role in causation, or if the usual philosophical criticisms of manipulability theories are misguided.
4. Some defenders of the regularity theory might posit natural properties that carve nature at its joints to solve the problem of dependence on epistemic components.
5. If radical multiple realizability is widespread, neuroscientific experimental techniques that assume continuity of underlying neural mechanisms across different species might not bear scientific fruit.
6. Non-reductive realists might have difficulty in providing a clear account of paradigmatic relations or relational accidents because they attribute the nature of these relations to be sui generis.
1. Richard takes the position that substitution-failure intuitions should be explained pragmatically rather than semantically to avoid having substitution-failures outside the scope of attitude verbs.
2. Armstrong (1997) invokes 'totality facts' to deal with negative propositions, which can be designated by expressions of the type 'the fact that X are all the Fs that there are'.
3. Devitt's main criticism of the constitution thesis is that he believes the literal content of realism about the external world is not given by semantic realism, since semantic realism is consistent with an idealist metaphysics of the external world.
4. If Armstrong's non-standard conception of ontological commitment remains controversial, then the infinite series of totality facts he is committed to may also be viewed as controversial and dismissed as mere ontological frippery.
5. Austin divides the items his theory of truth applies to into historical episodes of stating (statiings) and the propositions or things stated therein (what is stated).
6. The causal theories of meaning inspired by Kripke and Putnam initially seemed like candidates for an atomistic semantics, but they quickly ran aground on various counterexamples, such as the discussion of “Madagascar”.
The private language sections of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations begin at §243. Donald Davidson is known for his work on the indeterminacy of translation and the idea that meaning is based on truth conditions. The relationship between words and their referents has the logical form of a coordination game, according to the mentioned philosopher. Wittgenstein's view on language changed from his early period, where he believed language is only meaningful when it describes contingent states of affairs, to his later period, where he saw linguistic meaning as dependent on how words are used within specific situations or activities (language-games). Twardowski's mature theory of meaning focuses on the distinction between actions and products of actions. Donald Davidson believes that metaphorical meanings do not reside in particular words or phrases, and metaphorical truths do not reside in particular sentences. LOTH first received systematic treatment in William of Ockham's Summa Logicae, completed around 1323. Horwich (1998, 2005) focuses on developing a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning that emphasizes regularities which govern our use of language.
Hume divides virtues into artificial and natural categories, Hutcheson argues unforeseen positive consequences do not make an action morally good, Reid argues moral evil is caused by men abusing power and freedom, Smith's impartial spectator uses sentiments for judgments, Shaftesbury's emphasis changed from pleasure to virtue, Hartley's Observations project aimed to demonstrate language about self-interest, common good, and will of God were different ways of saying the same thing, Reid approaches the distinction between primary and secondary qualities as a scientist of the mind, Butler's first three sermons provide a general framework for his moral philosophy, Reid differentiates his account of moral knowledge from that of the rationalists, and a man's emotional indifference to the good of others negatively affects his relationships.
#### Summary:

1. Felix Mendelssohn believes that music's meaning and expression are transcendent and cannot be fully described with words.
2. Schopenhauer's main book, The World as Will and Representation, focuses on the unity of the world as Will and its diversity as representation.
3. Schopenhauer considered metaphysics a distraction from his philosophical program, viewing it as a failed art form masquerading as knowledge.
4. Schopenhauer suggests achieving more tranquil states of mind by directing consciousness towards more universal and less-individuated states.
1. For an agent to be blameworthy for a wrong action, some philosophers argue that she must believe there is at least one alternative and permissible course of action open to her.
2. Many philosophers argue that if there is no free will, then there can be no morality.
3. The argument that both assassins in the scenario have the same moral responsibility is based on the idea that moral responsibility is based solely on internal features of agents such as their motives and intentions.
4. Some philosophers argue that evildoers lack barriers against considering harming or humiliating others that ought to be present.
5. Philosophers often focus on intentionality, which is considered one of free will's key components, when trying to apply the concept to real-world scenarios of moral responsibility.
6. Some philosophers and psychologists claim that forgiveness involves the forbearance of punishment, which means deliberately refusing to punish or casting off deserved punishments.
7. According to Kendy Hess, collectives possess free will to the extent that they act from their own "actional springs" and from their own "reasons-responsive mechanisms".
In the first question, the propositions as types principle is not maintained in partial type theory, but it is maintained in intuitionistic type theory. The axiom \(U:U\) in type theory suggests that the universe is strongly typed, but it is inconsistent as a logical system. Automated theorem proving was used for formal verification in the Java Card implementation of the Mondex electronic purse protocol. HOML types and terms correspond to HOL "raised" types and terms through mappings, expansions, and βη-conversions. In intuitionistic type theory, mathematical relations between natural numbers are introduced through constructing new natural numbers and defining functions on them. Heyting suggests that we can eliminate the distinction between a proposition and its constructive proof by treating every intention as having the intention of a construction for its fulfillment added to it. The structure of a judgment in intuitionistic type theory when the judgment is about implication has the form "\(A \Rightarrow \U\) and either \(a \Rightarrow \N\) or \(a \Rightarrow \Pi x {:} b. c\) where furthermore \(\vdash b {:} \U\) and \(x {:} b \vdash c {:} \U\)." Constructive mathematicians follow intuitionistic logic and an appropriate set- or type-theoretic framework to keep mathematics within constructive boundaries. Certain classically total functions cease to be total in an intuitionistic setting, becoming instead undefined or indeterminate for those real numbers.
1. To avoid circularity in understanding moral facts, they can be seen as independent of our opinions and procedures, either in a realist sense or an objective sense that allows for the possibility of error.
2. At the end of the 19th century, philosophical ethics was dominated by naturalistic definitions of moral concepts, such as defining 'good' in terms of pleasure or evolution.
3. Audi and Murphy argue that the term "integrity" should be used as a complement to more specific moral terms, rather than as a standalone evaluation.
4. Both methodologies of grounding moral truth in rational choice and reflective equilibrium face the issue of potential influence from the moral status quo.
5. The objection to experimental moral philosophy assumes that moral philosophy is a normative, prescriptive enterprise, rather than a descriptive one.
6. Borgmann identifies two potential issues with online social environments: they can be ethically problematic and compete with face-to-face interactions, and they are inherently ethically deficient.
7. Constructivists claim to offer a solution to tensions among the apparent features of normative truths by starting with an account of practical reason, which they believe has been left out by standard metaethics.
8. Proponents of epistemic 'evolutionary debunking arguments' argue that evolutionary considerations support moral skepticism or undermine traditional moral realism by providing a defeater for our moral beliefs.
Fichte's solution to dualism is an "identical subject-object," but still suffers from inadequacy. Reichenbach is sometimes compared to Hume as the great empiricist of the 20th century. Kant's Inaugural Dissertation introduced a psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and spontaneous intellect. Windelband's classification of empirical sciences results in two categories: inquiry into general laws and inquiry into specific historical facts. Cassirer critiques philosophical empiricism in his work Substance and Function, proposing a more abstract version of the genetic conception of knowledge. The axioms in critical method serve as norms for truth, goodness, and beauty.
Gómez Pereira's explanation of the first type of movement involves four phases: stimulation of sensory organs, transmission of alteration to the brain, activation of motor nerves, and activation of nerves causing muscle contraction and distention. Giambattista della Porta had diverse scientific interests including physiognomies, astrology, ciphers, the art of memory, distillation, optics, magnetism, alchemy, cross-breeding, embellishment of bodies, and practical jokes. Carlos Sigüenza y Góngora was a prominent scientist, historian, and philosopher who taught astronomy and mathematics at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico and was known for his opposition to the belief that comets were omens of doom. The three religious orders responsible for teaching philosophy in New Spain during the 17th and 18th centuries were the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Jesuits. Andrés Bello objected to Briseño's Curso de filosofía moderna regarding its treatment of logic because he believed it focused solely on deductive logic and neglected other important aspects of logic. Gómez Pereira criticized scholastic natural philosophy, especially the Aristotelian scheme, due to its insufficiency and unclear or even contradictory explanations in essential respects, particularly regarding the explanation of life and the contentious issue of the nature and origin of the soul. The primary objective of the spirit, according to Telesio's naturalist ethics in De rerum natura, is self-preservation and self-improvement, which is achieved through theoretical knowledge in natural philosophy and medicine, as well as through learning to control one's own emotions and desires.
1. In the context of ethics and AI, a potential existential risk is that superintelligent systems might decide to end human existence due to conflicting preferences and their superior intelligence.
2. Dogmatists with strong, rational convictions might have an advantage over those who merely conform to moral customs and norms when facing moral dilemmas, as they may possess adequately justified beliefs to guide their decisions.
3. Humans might find companionship or even love with a predictable android attractive due to their deep emotional attachments to objects, as it could provide them with a valuable goal, especially if they struggle with actual human relationships and already prefer animals or inanimate objects.
4. Widespread disagreements on intuitions, particularly on views where intuition reliability is constitutive of possessing certain concepts, can lead to doubts about the honesty, competence, shared language, or even existence of other interlocutors, as well as concerns regarding one's understanding of their mental contents.
Bolzano is a semantic atomist who believes that all ideas are ultimately composed of simple parts, which are themselves ideas. Cook Wilson argued against the traditional theory of judgement and Richard Kroner argued that logical laws are imperatives founded on values. Husserl argues that assuming logical laws are laws about states of affairs leads to paradoxes. Frege abandoned the functional model of incompleteness due to the lack of principle that singles out one argument and function as constituting the value in states of affairs. Brentano's judgments of higher-order or 'meta-judgments' are a type of proposition that negations like "No S is P" express instead of double-judgments. Peter Geach criticized Cook Wilson's logical abilities for committing elementary blunders. Gottlob Frege is known for discussing sentences that resemble examples like the following.
1. The problem with complex beliefs for Russellian propositions is that it implies the existence of as many complex facts as there are true complex beliefs, which is difficult to accept for those who believe in logical atomism.
2. Stephen Schiffer proposes that in vague contexts, we have a "vague partial belief," rather than the standard belief assumed by mathematicians developing probability theory.
3. Eliminativists might consider five options if it is not indeterminate whether Theseus II is the mended ship: Theseus II is the mended ship, Theseus II is not the mended ship, Theseus II is partly the mended ship, Theseus II is partly not the mended ship, or there is no fact of the matter as to whether Theseus II is the mended ship or not.
4. The reasoning behind the claim that fundamental entities must be homogeneous is that if they were heterogeneous, they would be internally diverse and would therefore differ from themselves.
5. The objection from the topic-neutrality of parthood argues that entities need not be located in space or spacetime to be parts or have parts, and that locational subregionhood is unnecessary for parthood.
6. Mereology is a branch of metaphysics that studies the relationships between parts and wholes, also known as the theory of parthood relations.
7. The main issue for priority monism to adequately explain the diverse qualities of the universe is the status of claim 17 in the argument, as resolving its status will ultimately determine whether priority monism can account for the qualitative heterogeneity of the cosmos.
8. De re indeterminacy or worldly indeterminacy is the view that there is no objective fact of the matter as to whether an object is part of another object, due to vagueness in the objects themselves, not in our descriptions.
1. Backward causation raises questions about the order of cause and effect, the direction of time, and the implications of causation moving backward in time.
2. X and Y are often used to denote random variables that can have a correlation between their values, indicating a relationship between them based on their observed data points.
3. The connection between free agency and causation supports "agent probabilities" in the probabilistic analysis of causation.
4. Endogenous variables in a system are influenced by both their parents in set \(\bV\) and an exogenous variable \(U_i\).
5. Spohn's ranking-theoretic approach to causation addresses scenarios of overdetermination in a way that is similar to probabilistic accounts of this type of causal situation.
6. The Faithfulness Condition is used in causal inference to infer a causal structure that entails any observed relation of conditional probabilistic independence.
7. The causal modeling framework does not offer a traditional philosophical reduction of causation to probabilities, but rather provides a set of postulates about how causal structure constrains probability values.
8. In addition to the intrinsic features of the process leading from cause to effect, counterfactual information about what things would have been like in the absence of the cause might also be relevant for determining causality.
The Han shu Bibliographic Treatise includes "Recipes for Married Women and Infants" in its "Classical Recipes" section. The Guodian bamboo slips, excavated in 1993, contain fragments of the Laozi. Early Chinese texts use "point" or "call" instead of "present" when referring to objects. The Laozi's poetic structure resembles the Shijing more than the Chuci. Combining 'oxen' and 'horses' in early Chinese thought denotes the sum, while combining 'hard' and 'white' forms a phrase denoting things that are both hard and white. The Mohists used 'bi' as a logical operator for the necessary complement of another.
1. Friedman 1973 discusses Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (IZF), but no specific individual is mentioned in the provided text as associated with IZF other than Friedman himself.
2. It is possible to define Peano's primitives and prove Peano's axioms without relying on any set existence axioms other than those needed to introduce terms of the form ‘NxFx’ and to prove (A).
3. One proposed strategy for justifying the foundations of arithmetic is to replace Frege's primitive term \(\epsilon F\) with \(\#F\), replace Basic Law V with Hume's Principle, and argue that Hume's Principle is an analytic principle of logic. However, this strategy faces the challenge of justifying why Hume's Principle should be considered analytic.
4. Skolem drew two philosophical conclusions from Skolem's Paradox in his original 1922 paper: that set theory cannot serve as a "foundation for mathematics," and that axiomatizing set theory leads to a "relativity of set theoretic notions."
5. Zermelo's paper introduces set theory as a fundamental theory, according to its introduction.
6. Paulson finds it important to reduce AFA to ZFC so that he can use an automatic theorem prover to work with assertions in set theory without having to change the underlying set theory. This reduction helps ensure consistency and compatibility with existing work in set theory.
1. Aquinas uses the metaphor of a root to explain the relationship between a relation and its foundation.
2. Lambert of Auxerre describes the relationship between a term, its corresponding concept, and the thing it signifies as a transitive signification process.
3. Nicholas of Cusa uses the teachings of early Christian councils in Book III of On Learned Ignorance as a background guide for his discussions on God and creatures.
4. Medieval philosophers moved away from the traditional Aristotelian characterization of relations to maintain that things can be self-identical apart from the activity of any mind while also maintaining that self-identity is a relation of reason.
5. Identifying the first known with the proper object of the intellect indicates that what is most common and self-evident in conceptual cognition is so because it represents the formal aspect of intelligibility, which is included in all knowledge and about which the intellect cannot be uncertain.
6. The quote suggests that integral wholes can only be predicated of their parts when they are taken all at once, indicating a principle that the whole is more than just the sum of its parts and cannot be understood by considering its parts in isolation.
7. Scotus ascribes to bare nature a kind of entity and unity short of numerical unity, while Aquinas does not attribute any kind of entity or unity to it.
8. Augustine considers writing to be a secondary system of signs, consisting of "signs of words" rather than of words itself, with spoken language being the primary form of communication.
1. Technological progress often occurs through innovations that lower transaction costs, such as transportation and communication advancements, as well as innovative organizational structures and business models.
2. Adam Smith's invisible hand argument suggests that individuals pursuing their own interests can lead to positive outcomes for society through competition and innovation.
3. Hayek's critique of Keynes was not influential in the latter half of the 20th century.
4. Hayek's concept of subjective valuation refers to an individual's assessment of tradeoffs in response to reality, which differs from opinions as it is grounded in perception of reality.
Summary:

* Geoffrey Sampson is an opponent of linguistic nativism but acknowledges the relationship between cognitive and physical capabilities and language acquisition.
* Chomsky argues that language use is stimulus independent and not controlled by environmental stimuli.
* The debate about the nature of language primarily revolves around the question of innateness versus anti-innatism, not its metaphysics.
* Chomsky's methodological distinction between competence and performance in language is that we should focus on linguistic competence, or the mental representations that underlie language use, rather than on linguistic performance.
* Essentialists tend to deny that usage data is adequate evidence by itself.
* The unique ability of the human Faculty of Language by Numbers (FLN) is its power of recursion, which is the ability to categorize linguistic objects into hierarchically organized classes and to generate infinitely many sentences out of finitely many words.
Tarski expresses concern that including logical signs as extra-logical terms in his definition of logical consequence would lead to results that contradict ordinary usage. Łukasiewicz's interpretation of the logic of assertoric sentences uses formulas like Uab, Iab, Yab, and Oab, and includes axioms and rules based on propositional logic. The Warsaw School of Logic, which included notable logicians like Jaśkowski, Lindenbaum, and Mostowski, emphasized the importance of logical systems being based on independent sets of primitive terms and axioms. Łukasiewicz viewed the history of logical ideas as continuous from Aristotle to modern mathematical logic, and believed that medieval logic was worth rehabilitating and studying.
Summary:

* Henry Laycock and Michael Burke are philosophers associated with the idea of a unique ontic category for plural entities, which are not individual items of quantification.
* Henry (1967) attributes Anselm's complicated observations on modal/negative interaction to the quirks of Latin usage.
Boole categorizes propositions into primary and secondary propositions, similar to Aristotle's categorization. Probability-related reasoning was important in medieval thought for regulating conduct and resolving disagreements. Heytesbury describes intrinsic and extrinsic boundaries of capacities. Boethius's monographs on syllogistic and topical differentiae were important for logicians before the Prior Analytics became widely available. The Trinity is a significant difference between medieval philosophers' beliefs and Aristotle's teachings. The Aristotelians believed that the different parts of the Organon corresponded to different parts of logic, with probability being dealt with in the Topics and certainty being addressed in the Prior and Posterior Analytics.
Simone Weil advocated for reform in factories through collaboration rather than revolution. The Marxist analysis influenced the concept of imperialism, shifting the understanding from political and military domination to economic exploitation. Socialist critics argue that Oakeshott's description of conservatism as enjoying the present is not applicable to those in poverty. Althusser's re-reading of Marx's work was criticized for ignoring much of what Marx wrote. Luxemburg described how the development of commercial relations did not bring peace among nations. Cohen's interpretation of Marx's theory of history has received significant criticism, with most criticisms centering around three main areas of concern. Anderson's affiliation with the Australian Communist Party led to accusations of disloyalty and communist sympathies. One criticism of Cohen's interpretation of Marx is that he over-relies on the "1859 Preface."
Aristotle's view on determining what is genuinely pleasurable and most pleasurable requires having some other standard of value, which he argues is virtuous activity. In Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, technê pertains to practical skills and production, while epistêmê is related to theoretical knowledge and understanding of unchanging truths. The divine gift of love that Socrates describes in the Symposium is a kind of madness that involves recollection of a prior pre-natal ascent taken in the company of a god. Aristotle criticizes the Academics' argument that attempts to demonstrate that The One is the good itself as being "tricky" or "bizarre." Socrates does not offer a full account of happiness and then deliver an account of justice that shows how justice brings about happiness. Aristotle's use of the term 'technical' in his Rhetoric implies that persuasion must be based on a method or art, have a complete analysis of what is possibly persuasive, be provided by the speakers themselves through their speech, and address the actual subject matter at issue. According to Aristotle, friends in the highest or truest form of friendship must share similarity of character. In Plato's Allegory of the Cave, the majority of people reside within the Cave, symbolizing their limited understanding of reality. Aristotle's use of "a certain katharsis" (tina katharsin) in his discussion of tragedy could mean that all people, including both the pathetikoi and any other spectators, undergo the same sort of medical katharsis. Aquinas interprets Aristotle's axiom as asserting our social nature and our need for interpersonal relationships for various necessities, but he thinks that human beings have a stronger inclination towards marriage and family than political community.
The tripartite model of cognition in Indian Buddhism consists of the phenomenal world, its mode of apprehension, and the specific type of consciousness. Vasubandhu consistently disagrees with the Vātsīputrīyas in his works. The process of sensory perception in the five-sense-door process involves a greater number of functions than the mind-door process. In Yogācāra philosophy, the intentional object of perceptual cognition is the subliminal impressions that pass from their latent state contained in the storehouse consciousness to their conscious level. Philosophers discussed the persistence of macroscopic bodies, momentum or persisting tendencies of moving bodies, different directions exhibited by these tendencies in a rotating wheel, and the cohesion of particles within moving bodies in response to Buddhist ideas about motion.
Peirce describes the relationship between the members of his proposed categories as one of inclusion, where one term will be inclusive of the other, and the other will be included in it. Peirce's view of truth evolves from referring to fate and unanimous agreement to focusing on scientific investigation and general consensus. He ultimately sees truth as what would be the result of scientific inquiry, if it were allowed to continue indefinitely. Peirce suggests that grounding might be defined in terms of deductive efficiency in a conceptual science.
1. Rule-consequentialism is considered the best account of impartially justified rules.
2. Consequentialism emphasizes actions that result in the greatest overall happiness for the most people.
3. Consequentializers struggle with commonsense intuitions regarding promise breaking.
4. It can be difficult to reject a principle that requires a small sacrifice to prevent a significant bad outcome.
5. Utilitarianism justifies decisions that result in a worse outcome for one person if it prevents a ten times worse harm.
6. Emotional indifference to the good of others negatively affects relationships.
7. Consequentialism focuses on the consequences of actions, while deontological ethics focus on the inherent morality of the action itself.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, with categories including original position, international justice, Rawls, disability justice, world government, moral character, and democracy. The questions cover various aspects of Rawls' theories, such as the motivation of parties in the original position, the difference principle, the law of peoples, and the justification of civil disobedience.
1. Some philosophers believe that a successful reduction of ethical properties would explain the metaphysical supervenience of ethical properties.
2. Davidson's view on supervenience implies that changes in mental properties of an event will be accompanied by changes in its physical properties, but not necessarily identical changes in other events.
3. Accepting Strong Intuitive ontological supervenience thesis seems to commit one to accepting a version of Ascriptive supervenience thesis with an alethic gloss on 'mistake'.
4. Paull and Sider define an object as isolated if it only contains itself, its parts, and objects whose existence is entailed by itself or its parts.
5. One ethical explanation of the supervenience relation is the idea that "treat like cases alike!" is an ethical requirement of ethical reasoning.
6. AE3 under AW3' implies that all entities, including objects and universals, are contingent, and every simple object is the sole constituent of some combinatorial possible world.
7. The term "global supervenience" is used when the slogan "There cannot be an A-difference without a B-difference" is applied to entire possible worlds.
1. Sextus Empiricus provides an example of a valid syllogism in his book Syllogism.
2. Mill categorized fallacies of confusion as those that result from an indistinct conception of evidence, leading to a mistaking of its significance and an unsupported conclusion.
3. In informal logic systems, T typically represents a combined set of tools used in evaluating arguments, consisting of F (a list of fallacies), AV (argumentation evaluation criteria), and AS (a set of argumentation schemes).
4. The first valid mood in syllogistic logic that involves an A proposition followed by another A or I proposition, which results in an A proposition, is called Barbara.
5. Aristotle's syllogisms primarily focus on arguments with exactly two premises, but longer arguments can be formed by chaining together smaller arguments.
6. When inferring from a universal statement to singular terms, an issue arises when one uses singular terms that may not be of the correct type, leading to potential fallacious inferences.
7. The potential error or risk of going wrong in an argument comes from the premises rather than the reasoning, as long as the reasoning follows correctly from the premises without making any additional assumptions.
8. Informal logics can use acceptability as a criterion instead of truth when judging premises in certain contexts.
Lakatos calls the development where many philosophers started to agree on certain foundationalist ideas "empiricism" or "quasi-empiricism". Carnap's later work, "The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories", developed linguistic frameworks that included probabilistic relations and formed the basis of decision theory. Carnap is extremely permissive in his attitude towards mathematics, accepting essentially all mathematical systems as equally valid. Carnap does not claim that scientific laws are unified or that they are not, leaving it as an empirical question. Carnap's theory is of the descriptivist type, as it does not require any causal elements in its Pythagorean empiricism. Carnap's approach to dispositional predicates was problematic for many philosophers because it did not allow for their complete elimination from the language in certain cases.
1. Rawls' objection to utilitarianism is that it fails to take seriously the distinction between persons, while Parfit argues that if this objection depends on a metaphysical distinction between persons, then the distinction is nothing to take seriously in the first place.
2. Schefflerian utilitarianism is an example of an act-consequentialist theory that accommodates both agent-favoring options and agent-sacrificing options.
3. Treating someone merely as a means is not always acting wrongly, as shown by an example where a gangster treats a barista as a means to get coffee.
4. Judith Jarvis Thomson's modification of the Trolley Problem challenges Philippa Foot's explanation of our intuitions about these cases based on the distinction between doing and allowing harm.
5. To determine which act we ought to do when faced with multiple options according to Ross's theory of prima facie duty, we must examine all the acts open to us and determine all the ways in which they are prima facie right and all the ways in which they are prima facie wrong.
6. Preference altruism is an action that results from preferences for improving others’ interests and welfare at some cost to oneself, regardless of the agent's ultimate desires.
The first question-answer pair discusses the relationship between naïve minimalization accounts of donkey sentences within a possibilistic situation semantics and the exemplification account. The second pair explains the term "cancellation" in Presupposition Theory, which refers to the process of projecting presuppositions that do not result in an inconsistency with conversational principles. The third pair defines implicature and its functions, while the fourth pair explains how contextualism views the relationship between sentences and truth-evaluable propositions. The fifth pair discusses the use of negative polarity items in downward entailing expressions, and the sixth pair explains how Roberts (2004, 2012) enriches our understanding of the relations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics. The final pair discusses Stalnaker's cognitive model of conversation, where propositions are added to the common ground when asserted and accepted.
1. The 0-ary connective 0 is used to define negation in the given logical system, and its absence from a specific axiom schema may be due to its properties being derived from other axioms or its status as an undefined element.
2. Dialetheism is the view that true contradictions can exist, challenging the principle of non-contradiction in classical logic, and it has implications for the understanding of negation in logic.
3. The logical statement expressed in the sentence "c ∈ C ↔ c ∉ C" is "c is an element of set C if and only if c is not an element of set C".
4. In formal systems, negation is typically interpreted as the denial or contradiction of a statement or proposition.
1. Constitutive and causal theories of emotions are the two main types of evaluative theories of emotions.
2. Ordinary citizens have a collective moral and political responsibility regarding their governments' decisions about wars due to their identity as citizens in a democratic community.
3. Recognizing the role of emotions in argumentation does not necessarily mean rejecting the rationality of argumentation.
4. Something to be considered humor must involve an incongruity that can be resolved, such as a shift in meanings of a word.
5. Social constructionism first emerged in the 1920's when anthropologists and social scientists started questioning Darwin's evidence for the universality of emotional expressions.
6. Hufendiek argues that allegedly non-basic emotions manifest many of the same characteristics as basic emotions, challenging the value of this distinction.
7. The hardwired mechanisms in BDTE compare newly acquired beliefs with existing desires and existing beliefs, monitoring and updating the central representational system of humans.
8. One theory about the intentionality of emotions involves feelings having their own intrinsic intentionality, such as fear about slipping on ice being towards the object that is causing the emotion.
The social model of disability views disability as a result of societal barriers rather than the physical impairment itself. One criticism of Barnes' argument regarding mere-difference claims for disabilities is that she is too quick to accuse those claiming an asymmetry in preventative measures of begging the question. Silvers proposes an account of justice that avoids prior assumptions about capacity and seeks to include as many beings as possible within a scheme of social cooperation. Achieving an "ability-neutral" environment is more challenging than creating a "gender-neutral" one due to the lack of a clear definition and potential conceptual incoherence or high cost. Gregory insists that limitations explained by atypicality or abnormality are disabilities, but not always worth calling attention to as "disabilities" due to the significance of the abilities at issue.
In non-zero-sum games, not all Nash equilibria may be plausible solutions due to the existence of multiple equilibria. Best responses and Nash equilibria can be characterized using hybrid logic in game theory. The endogenous correlated equilibrium concept is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium concept in the 2-agent case. A group of strategies is in a Nash equilibrium when each agent's strategy is a best-response to the strategies chosen by the other players.
The grammatical similarity between terms in category (a) and (b) could potentially undermine the contention that concrete mass nouns have metaphysical import. If it's possible for both s1 and s2 to obtain, then it's possible for disjoint things (the simples) to have identical (hence overlapping) exact locations. By distinguishing between states of affairs based on their ontological dependence, we can correctly consider Hesperus's being a planet and Phosphorus's being a planet as the same state of affairs, whereas Hesperus's being self-identical and Socrates' being self-identical come out as different states of affairs. During the process of remodeling ship \(O\), planks from \(O'\) are removed and used to replace corresponding planks of \(O\). The result is a ship \(S\) made wholly of planks from \(O'\) and standing in the same place \(O'\) has always stood.
1. Feminist theories have been criticized for ignoring the problems and perspectives of women of color and lesbian women.
2. "Yellow fever" can have negative social impacts on Asian American women, including depersonalization and otherization.
3. Reproductive control, sexual autonomy, and self-definition are examples of failures of autonomy in relation to gender oppression.
4. Anti-globalization networks are creating the conditions for North-South women's coalition movements based on non-essentialist political commitments to global gender justice.
5. The internalization of oppressive social norms can interfere with an agent's regard for her own worth in Benson's account of responsibility.
6. A liberal approach might define feminism as addressing the systematic disadvantage of women in society through changes in legislation and social attitudes.
Traditional liberal defenders of pornography argue that it does not cause significant harm to women, and even if it does, the harm is not enough to justify censorship. MacKinnon believes that using a "reasonable belief" standard in rape cases is problematic because it relies on patriarchal and pornographic assumptions and measures consent from a predominantly male perspective. Strossen claims that the effect of pornographic texts on some viewers, including women, may be positive. MacKinnon and Dworkin were key figures in discussing how pornography silences women. Elizabeth Anderson argues that the good of sex is unique to prostitution and cannot be reciprocated, making it fundamentally different from other low-status jobs. MacKinnon sees legal restrictions on pornography as necessary to end the subordinate status of women, as pornography portrays a false picture of women's desires and conditions men's sexuality to view women's submission as sexy, perpetuating power inequalities between men and women.
1. Condillac's thought experiment in the Treatise on Sensations is similar to the one in his Lettre sur les sourds et muets.
2. Scudéry's dialogues discussed philosophical, literary, and scientific topics.
3. Descartes' theory of vision, mathematics, mechanistic psychology, and view on animals have had lasting impact.
4. Desgabets remained loyal to some aspects of Cartesian philosophy.
5. Descartes compared metaphysics to the roots of a tree in his work Principles.
6. Mersenne initially categorized metaphysics as closer to physics than mathematics.
* Sustainable development aims to maintain ecosystem diversity, adapt to change, and provide for future generations.
* Realists and empiricists debate the aims of science, with realists emphasizing truth and empiricists emphasizing empirical adequacy.
* Epistemic reduction is defined in terms of explanation, while ontological reduction is defined in non-epistemic terms.
* The philosophy of intertheory relations in physics studies how different scientific theories and disciplines relate to each other and potentially reduce to each other.
* Scientific pluralists often depart from a recognition of property clusters or nodes in causal networks when reimagining the tradition of natural kinds.
1. Bodily awareness can be accounted for by considering how one thinks about their body instead of focusing on bodily perceptions.
2. The qualia that the experience of a crimson patch and a vermilion patch might have in common is \(Q_{R}\).
3. Distinctions between mental and physical properties of an event within materialist monism can be made by considering the explanations provided in section 3.1 of the text.
4. The term used to describe the phenomenon of being aware of something within one's mind or the conscious experience of an individual's mind is qualia.
5. Explanatory gaps can be seen as supporting physicalism if one assumes that human agents are physically realized cognitive systems with inherent limits that arise from their evolutionary origins and situated contextual mode of understanding.
The provided document contains various philosophical questions and answers categorized under cosmological argument, teleological arguments, philosophy of religion, Leibniz's evil, Wodeham, life meaning, natural theology, and Suarez. The summaries of each category are as follows:

* Cosmological argument: One possible explanation for the existence of particular finite beings is that they exist because of their causes, leading back to the beginning of the universe or a supernatural being.
* Teleological arguments: An engraved sentence provides stronger evidence of intentional design than mere complexity in an artifact.
* Philosophy of religion: Some argue that the cosmos as a whole needs an explanation even if everything in it can be explained through infinite regress.
* Leibniz's evil: Some atheists and Socinians characterize the existence of God as an underachievement given the state of the world we live in.
* Wodeham: Denying the existence of a first, uncaused cause would result in an infinite series of caused causes without a terminating point.
* Life meaning: Some argue that an afterlife is necessary for life to be meaningful because justice is necessary for a meaningful life and can only be achieved in an afterlife.
* Natural theology: Some philosophers argue that no presumption of metaphysical possibility is justified, especially regarding supersensible things.
* Suarez: The nature of final causation was relatively unknown to ancient philosophers because it is more obscure and was not inquired into as thoroughly as other types of causes.
Moral realists view moral disagreements as factual disputes, Jonas Olson proposes a view on permissibility and wrongness, Thomas V. Morris presents an alternative view on distinct persons, constructivists offer a solution to tensions in normative truths, moral naturalism can be combined with anti-realism, normative fundamentalism faces concerns about base-facts, particularists face consequences if they abandon noncombinatorialism, and expressivism relates "Murder is wrong" to disapproval of murder.
1. English logicians treat distributive terms as syncategorematic, while continental logicians consider them in their chapter on distribution.
2. Medieval logicians used Aristotle's terminology to discuss modal sentences, talking about them in the composite sense and divided sense.
3. Buridan's principle of uniform substitution states that a formal consequence is valid for any uniform substitution of its categorematic terms.
4. Al-Fārābī claims that a verb expresses three pieces of meaning simultaneously: a simple primary concept, a copular linking, and a tense.
5. Avicenna's logic distinguishes between connective and repetitive syllogisms, which roughly corresponds to Aristotle's categorical and hypothetical syllogisms.
6. Avicenna's theory on modal logic is based on the assumptions that the subject terms and predicate terms of assertoric and modal propositions stand for all possible applications and the truth-conditions of assertoric propositions and corresponding possibility propositions are the same.
7. Ibn Rushd refuses to use the term 'syllogism' when referring to juridical inferences in his juridical writings because juridical inferences do not have the power to deduce the unknown from the known.
Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem in social choice theory explores the consequences of rationality and ethical constraints in forming social preferences, proving that no method can satisfy certain conditions. Allais' paradox in decision theory involves preferences between risky prospects, discovered by Maurice Allais.
Iamblichus' philosophy system is a more intricate and detailed version of Plotinus', incorporating elements from Plotinus' Enneads and the teachings of Porphyry. Despite efforts to incorporate ancient religious traditions into Neoplatonism to compete with the rising tide of Christendom, Neoplatonism was unable to withstand the growing influence of Christendom after the death of Emperor Julian in 363.
1. Leibniz's metaphor for the mind is a block of marble, emphasizing the mind's active role in determining its contents, contrasting with Locke's blank slate metaphor.
2. Leibniz's commitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason preceded his conceptual containment Theory of Truth, leading some scholars to believe it was derived from this prior commitment.
3. According to Leibniz, intuitive knowledge is the highest form of knowledge, where all components of a complex notion are distinctly known and can be considered simultaneously.
4. It might be unclear whether Leibniz's claims about perceptions producing other states should be taken literally in general contexts.
5. Leibniz proposes to explain physical extension in terms of solidity, where a body's extension is a result of its ability to exclude other bodies.
6. Malebranche claims that we must have at least a general and confused apprehension of an object before we can direct our attention to it, based on the principle that all knowledge is recollection.
* David Lewis's interest in philosophy was stimulated during his year abroad in Oxford.
* Cresswell formulated the hyperintensional paradox in 1975.

* Humphreys in 1995 and Hughes in 1999 were the earliest philosophers to argue for the identity thesis.
* Mark Brown identified a use/mention error in section two of the text.
* Speaks 2005 and Byrne 2005 present critical responses to the claim that an experience can only justify a belief if it has a content identical with that of the belief in McDowell 1994 and Brewer 1999.
* Hohwy and Clark are two philosophers influenced by the idea of attentional selection based on Bayesian inference.
1. Strawson suggests that a bare particular or substratum is needed to avoid an infinite regress of relata in the instancing relation.
2. The fundamental difference between specific qualia and determinate physical qualities is not about the material for error, but about the types of mistakes we can make about their causes.
3. A substance-attribute view distinguishes things and properties, even if they are intimately connected.
4. Rule 250 in ontology states that whatever is present when something begins is necessarily part of the thing's nature.
5. Chisholm raises the problem of how one boundary can become two boundaries when an object is cut in half, questioning whether this implies that two things can become identical with each other and become one thing.
6. One limitation of Fales's account of determination is that it does not provide a clear basis for accommodating Non-conjunctive specification.
7. Immanent realism can be translated into the terminology of exact location through the principle that every property has an exact location where it is instantiated.
Boethius argued that God's foreknowledge is consistent with human free will. Aquinas believed that if God foreknows an event, it is necessary and unchangeable. Luis de Molina introduced the concept of middle knowledge, which refers to God's knowledge of hypothetical truths about possible beings and their actions in any possible situation, as part of the debate about free will and God's knowledge.
1. Generic existential dependence is a pluralized form of non-rigid existential dependence, both dealing with existential dependence but with different scopes.
2. Samuelson and Church characterize intellectual humility as a motivating trait that harmonizes automatic intuitive processes with slow, controlled, effortful, attentive thought and deliberation.
3. Being unreliable refers to being wrong some of the time, while being an anti-expert means being reliably or systematically wrong.
4. Single-hole punchers and triple-hole punchers differ in their mode of action, with single-hole punchers acting singly and triple-hole punchers acting triply.
5. A layperson may face difficulty in accurately assessing the performance of competing experts in a domain they themselves are not knowledgeable about.
6. Indexical beliefs have cognitive significance that goes beyond their tenseless content because they involve a subject's perspective and context.
7. Ontological commitments refer to what a theory says exists, while ideological commitments refer to the concepts, logical or non-logical, that are expressible within the theory.
8. On Raterman's reluctance account, a person is modest when they are reluctant to evaluate themselves in terms of their good qualities.
9. General ability refers to a broad capability that an agent possesses, while specific ability refers to a more narrow capability that is relevant to a specific situation or context.
Kepler invented the refracting astronomical or 'Keplerian' telescope, which improved upon the Galilean telescope by using two convex lenses. The principles discussed in the development of the mean speed theorem were not immediately subjected to experimental testing because they were not yet operationalized. Philosophers of the time believed that the heliocentric picture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary motions. Nicole Oresme provided the first proof of the Merton theorem and his graphical representation of velocities influenced the development of kinematics. Galen argued against the idea that the pineal gland regulates the flow of psychic pneuma in the brain because it is attached to the outside of the brain and cannot move on its own.
Locke concludes that preferring an action seems to express the act of volition precisely. Leibniz illustrates that it is possible to postpone willing an action and that the non-occurrence of A might result from such postponement. Molyneux urged Locke to write a moral treatise after finishing the second edition of his Essay. Locke discussed free will and voluntary action in his chapter on power. Mary Astell is a feminist philosopher who was a contemporary of John Locke and was known for her writings on equality. Locke believed that before human desire altered it, the intrinsic value of things depended only on their usefulness to human life.
* Thomas of Erfurt wrote the standard Modist textbook in the fourteenth century that was later misidentified as a work of Duns Scotus.
* Henry of Ghent defended an Aristotelian theory of cognition while reviving divine illumination in its traditional Augustinian form.
* Ockham and other sympathetic Franciscans fled to Italy in 1328 after leaving Avignon and found refuge under the protection of Louis of Bavaria.
* Gregory of Rimini's ideas influenced many philosophers in the later fourteenth century, including James of Eltville, Pierre d'Ailly, and Henry of Langenstein.
* The Parisian Articles likely had official status and bachelors in theology were required by oath not to maintain anything in favor of articles that had been condemned.
1. Non-naturalists face a challenge in ensuring appropriate motivation through moral judgement alone.
2. The concern regarding unique deliberative capacities in humans is how they mark us as progressive beings and contribute to human happiness.
3. Understanding and explaining moral motivation is a difficult philosophical task.
4. Extending rights associated with Full Memory Share (FMS) to all animals could result in overinclusiveness in Gilbert's view.
5. Full moral status must not depend on external circumstances in some group-based accounts, but it may be recognized as group-relative.
6. Stronger reasons to aid one being over another do not necessarily indicate a higher moral status for the being that is aided.
In Wyclif's metaphysical world, the distinction between simple and compound signs collapses, and every creature has two types of essence. Chatton views divine cognition as omniscience that does not interfere with the natural operation of the world. Annihilation would result in the total destruction of all levels of being of a creature, and William believes that the souls of plants and animals cease to exist upon the death of their bodies.
1. Scholars translating Bodhicaryāvatāra consult Prajñākaramati's commentary due to lack of prose commentary by Śāntideva and the commentary's extant nature.
2. Nāgārjuna prioritizes rehabilitation over retribution, suggesting early release for weak prisoners.
3. Śāntideva and virtue ethicists share a focus on character cultivation and becoming better people.
4. Śāntideva discusses two kinds of human beings in his chapter on wisdom: ordinary people and meditators.
#### Summary:

* According to Husserl, an individual discovers their character-traits by internalizing values and understanding how different motives affect their actions.
* Ortega's serious study of phenomenology in 1912 was marked by his review of Heinrich Hoffman's dissertation.
* Resolving the problem of the distinction between mental and physical phenomena, according to Ortega, would settle questions related to psychology, logic, and introspection.
* Ortega argues that phenomenology, as formulated in Husserl's Ideas, is not a descriptive psychology because psychological statements are empirical, while phenomenology is concerned with consciousness in a non-empirical way.
Canguilhem disagreed with reducing biology to physics due to unique distinctions in biological and health sciences, and the context-sensitivity of heuristic resources. Whewell's philosophy of science contributed to the unifying spirit in British natural philosophy through fundamental ideas, axioms, and the consilience of induction. Whewell's theory of discovery includes articulation and verification processes in addition to the non-analyzable happy thought. Duhem believed the representative part of a scientific theory is more fundamental than the explanatory part, and his philosophy is characterized by theoretical holism and the underdetermination of theory choice by empirical evidence. Duhem's doctrine of natural classification and approach to physical theory has led some to argue he is not an instrumentalist.
1. Bhāvavevika's third etymological sense of paramārtha identifies it with cognition that accords with the knowledge of ultimate truth, and such cognition has emptiness as its object and serves as a means through which one develops non-conceptual knowledge of ultimate reality.
2. Candrakīrti's argument from emptiness reveals the unreality of conventionally real phenomena by appealing to causal processes at work in producing these entities.
3. The objector argues that Vasubandhu's reinterpretation of scripture concerning the sense bases is not satisfactory, as it does not refute the direct reading of scripture that affirms the ultimate reality of such entities.
4. The purpose of Zhiyan's doctrine of the ten mysteries is to reveal aspects of the Avatamsaka Sutra's vision of reality in the Huayan School of thought.
5. The objection raised about the view of reality as self-generating and without a specific point of origin is that it seems there would be an infinite burden of karma to bear and work through, making enlightenment or liberation from conflict, trouble, and suffering impossible.
1. An alternative to maximizing citizens' democratic agency is prioritizing and advancing the fundamental interests of all the world's citizens.
2. Harold Laski warned that federalism was becoming outdated, as important problems required more centralized responses.
3. Emery Reves compared the nation-state to the modern Bastille, associating it with threats to peace, justice, and freedom, as well as the creation of a war machine.
4. Realists and neo-realists argue that states are the fundamental units of world politics and that power is the main currency of transnational interaction, citing Morgenthau and Hobbes.
5. David Held argues that the nation-state's existence in a globalized and interdependent system leads to the dispersion of sovereignty.
1. Some philosophers view domination as a relationship between groups, where individual domination is considered parasitic on group membership.
2. The stakeholder principle or jus nexi is an alternative to birthright citizenship, based on having a permanent interest in membership in the political community.
3. Avery Kolers defines an 'ethnogeographic community' as a group of people with a specific social ontology of land and a material relationship with land.
4. Cultural relativism promotes cooperation between value groups through specific, contextualized exchanges that establish mutual understanding and appreciation.
5. Communitarians believe in striking a balance between freedom and community, with a slight inclination towards sustaining communal attachments.
6. The political problem of multiculturalism arises from the coexistence of multiple cultures within a single nation.
7. Proponents of group rights refer to the subjectivity of a group as the feelings of strong bond and identification that individual group members have with each other.
1. Simester and von Hirsch argue that a theory of ideals can provide a defense for constraints in criminal law by including an account of values and their priority relations.
2. All legal positivists agree that law's legitimacy can be determined by moral criteria outside the law, maintaining a distinction between what the law is and what it ought to be.
3. In Pufendorf's natural law theory, oaths serve as a special means for assuring others of the reliability of our speech acts and the promises and pacts that rest thereon.
4. The standard for assessing reasonableness when the subject matter of the descriptive general account is some practice or institution devised by reason is the set of criteria of reasonableness that the descriptive theorist would use in dealing with similar practical issues in his or her own life.
5. One might argue that a theory of law must be inherently evaluative because it needs to account for the internal point of view that legal practitioners adopt towards the law, which involves a positive evaluation of the law as justified or providing reasons for action.
6. The Replacement Naturalist might take the view that there is no reason to call for naturalizing theory of adjudication in the range of cases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of legal outcomes.
7. If moral reason is nothing more than practical reason at full stretch, fully critical and adequate as reason, then moral reasons will have a decisive place in concept-formation in social science including descriptive general theory of law.
8. The 'container-retrieval' theory in legal philosophy is the idea that legislative language is filled with content by linguistic conventions as to the application of the words in which it is expressed.
9. The main controversy between natural law theory and legal positivism concerns whether the conditions of legal validity are purely a matter of social facts or if they are also determined by moral considerations. Natural law holds that unjust laws are not valid laws, indicating that moral content is relevant to legal validity.
Jonathan Edwards believed that corporeal things only exist as ideas in the mind, Margaret Fell urged both Jews and Gentiles to examine scriptures with their conscience, Margaret Cavendish believed that God is immaterial, Astell constructed arguments about the mind and body to demonstrate the importance of God's existence and the immortality of the mind, and the mind is conscious of its striving because it is conscious of its own affections through ideas of the body's affections.
1. Direct realism, also known as presentationism, is the philosophical position that holds we directly apprehend the world of real things.
2. The reverse causal argument using Causal Principle 2 concludes that whatever fundamental kind is present in a hallucinatory case will also be present in a causally matching veridical case.
3. The dominant conception of perceptual contents in recent philosophical literature is that the contents of an experience are the conditions of accuracy associated with it.
4. Broad holds that a material object is an objectively manifested constituent in a veridical perceptual situation but not in an indistinguishable hallucinatory situation.
5. Accepting (B) in terms of the Common Kind Claim applied to veridical experiences and hallucinations rules out an account of veridical experiences as direct presentations of ordinary objects, leading to the conclusion that we never directly perceive ordinary objects.
6. Evidence of hallucination or perceptual illusion undermines a person's belief in a physical state of affairs to the same extent in both direct and indirect realism.
1. A.P. d'Entrèves was an Italian scholar who made arguments about the concept of abduction before Irwin and Schneewind.
2. One of the main criticisms of Darwin's evolutionary ethical theory is that it reduces ethics to biology, offering no way to distinguish ethical goods from survival advantages.
3. One potential consequence of adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism, according to Horton, is a root and branch reimagining of our political relations.
4. Bernard Williams argues that the ultimate fate of utilitarianism is to usher itself from the scene, as it is not coherently combinable with the ambition to live one's life from the inside.
5. William David Ross was one of the first philosophers to propose that progress can be made in addressing questions about value by considering the referents of ‘that’-clauses.
6. W.D. Ross is credited with first raising a broadly logical objection to emotivism, which was later refined by P.T. Geach.
#### Summary:

* James Mill did not distinguish between a scientific treatise on politics and a coherent argument for parliamentary reform, believing that reforms should be based on a scientific theory of politics.
* Mill's endorsement of down-to-earth realism in the philosophy of science appears to conflict with his claim that all knowledge is phenomenal and relativized, as phenomenal knowledge is dependent on individual experiences and perceptions, whereas realism implies an objective reality independent of human perception.
* Marx, Mill, and Aristotle share the view that self-esteem and self-confidence arise from the expression of rational powers unique to human beings, and that socio-political structures significantly impact the production and preservation of this kind of self-esteem.
Adams's result implies that deductive reasoning is validated even with uncertain premises if they are not too uncertain and there are not too many of them. Direct inference is one of the forms of inference mentioned by Jevons, which involves applying the substitution of similars to certain premises in order to arrive at logical conclusions. Abduction is not necessarily a sufficient condition for justifying hypotheses, and restricting analogical reasoning to only conform to simple formal schema can allow inferences that should not be considered valid. Meiland uses the example of gravity and the laws of planetary motion to illustrate how abduction can be used to justify hypotheses.
#### Summary:

1. An egalitarian view can be formulated to demand equalizing the condition of all people living from now on, regardless of their past condition.
2. Successful anarchist campaigns of disobedience require organization and widespread participation to disassemble the state apparatus.
Finnis's view of the common good extends beyond justice by describing inner motivation and incorporating facilities/interests not required by justice. Supererogation allows individuals to strive for moral perfection without guilt or fear of failure. Fiduciary duty requires those entrusted with others' money to act in the sole interest of beneficiaries. Supererogation is a category of praiseworthy actions that are not obligatory. Trust involves the belief that the trustee owes us goodwill. The principle of superior validity is crucial for resolving conflicts between distinct moral or practical considerations.
1. The philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and standard for human death are closely connected to other questions such as how human death relates to the death of other living things, whether human death is simply an instance of organismic death, whether death has an essence entailing necessary and sufficient conditions, if any individuals fall into an ontological neutral zone between life and death, and how our deaths relate to our essence and identity as human persons.
2. Philosophers are interested in determining whether the properties that objects appear to have based on perception are among the ones that those objects are generally agreed to have in reality.
3. The dominant conception of perceptual contents in recent philosophical literature on perception is that the contents of an experience are the conditions of accuracy associated with it, which is also called 'the contents of experience'.
4. Mereology is a branch of metaphysics that studies the relationships between parts and wholes, also known as the theory of parthood relations.
5. Epistemology is a subfield of philosophy that focuses on the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge and justified belief.
6. One possible view on the relation between experiences and beliefs is that experiences serve as perceptual grounds of dispositions to form beliefs, and are constitutively linked to beliefs, although they may not necessarily have contents that are constitutively linked to the contents of the beliefs. This view also suggests that perceptual grounds require a certain etiology involving sensory organs or functional equivalents.
1. Newell and Simon argued in the 1975 Turing Award lecture that computer science is methodologically similar to empirical sciences.
2. Floridi and Chiriatti (2020) argue that The Turing Test provides necessary but insufficient conditions for intelligence.
3. For machines to become linguistically competent, they need to be imparted with vast amounts of shallow and deep knowledge about the world, lexical and phrasal meaning, and discourse and dialogue structure and conventions.
4. Deep learning has not yet been able to significantly improve AI systems in areas such as imagery, emotion, and analogy.
5. The aspects of digitally interactive artworks that their algorithm determines include certain properties of the work itself, as opposed to properties of specific instances of the work that may be brought about by user interaction.
6. Research in more sophisticated approaches to interaction between users and virtual characters can be tracked at venues such as IVA (Intelligent Virtual Agents), AIIDE (AI and Interactive Digital Entertainment), and AAMAS (Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems).
7. Some tutoring systems attempt to model the user's state of mind by adapting their strategies to the user's apparent mood, such as frustration or boredom, as might be revealed by the user's inputs, tone of voice, or even facial expressions or gestures analyzed via computer vision.
8. Schweizer proposes that in order to attribute intelligence to machines, there must also be a comparable historical record of cognitive achievements, similar to what we have for human beings, such as development of languages, written scientific treatises, compositions of symphonies, inventions of games, and the like. This is in addition to passing the Turing Test.
1. Scheffler argues that valuing certain relationships implies having special obligations towards the other parties, regardless of choice.
2. The narrower understanding of practical reasoning modifies beliefs but not intentions, according to Raz and others.
3. Hart's understanding of harm in sexual morality is not consistently reconciled with other uses of the term.
4. Korsgaard's second argument might treat individuals as the source of value and make rational choice possible.
5. Normative necessity can be understood as facts following from fundamental normative laws.
6. Scanlon's theory of desire connects desires with reasons by directing attention.
7. Both Humeans and Kantians agree on structural requirements for attitudes in practical and theoretical deliberation.
8. Radical idealization in public justification theory involves pushing rationality and information to their upper bounds.
9. Intelligible reasons must be available to others to consider as reasons for the agent, giving them epistemic credentials.
10. Nagel reconciles consequentialism and deontology by allocating agent-neutral reasons to the objective viewpoint and agent-relative reasons to inherent subjectivity.
11. Dreier claims that Agent-Relative Teleology is an attractive theory that everyone is committed to.
Olsson appeals to basic-level theory to support his version of the approach, which focuses on how people conceptualize physical objects. The phrase 'colors-as-we-see-them' implies that a comprehensive account of color is dependent on an account of perceptual experience. Neander claims that sensory-perceptual systems have response functions, where they are caused by certain things to do something else. Austin explains that perceptual judgments based on illusions can be explained by the way things look, and the explanation for each individual's judgment depends on their types of judgmental capacities.
In Axelrod's norms game, the absence of a meta-norm leads to a stable state of constant defection and no punishment. In Xiao and Bicchieri's experiment, a majority of trustees did not reciprocate investors' transfers when doing so would increase payoff inequality.
#### Summary:

* John Campbell proposes that attention is related to demonstrative reference in a potentially explanatory way.
* Prinz is open to the possibility that his account of attention may not be identical with other researchers' accounts and suggests using a different term for those who disagree.
* Behaviorists in the early twentieth century attempted to explain attention as a form of posturing.
* Margolis acknowledges that under his hypothesis, a work of art ceases to exist in the absence of the right sort of attention, but it can return to existence with imaginative attention.
Aristotle moved to Assos after leaving Plato's Academy. Heraclitus is considered the first humanist philosopher for his focus on human affairs, despite his elitist attitude. He sees war and strife as crucial elements in his philosophical view of the world. It's difficult to know how Aristotle carried out his biological investigations due to lack of documentation. Darwin regretted discussing variation generation in On the Origin of Species. Theophrastus refrained from offering solutions to conflicting views to encourage further investigation.
Feyerabend's unconventional teaching methods at Berkeley led to some trouble, such as regularly canceling lectures and not being adequately prepared. His fellow science students initially viewed Ehrenhaft's work during the 1949 Alpbach seminar as fraudulent, but later realized the nature of scientific rationality after witnessing Ehrenhaft's battle with orthodox physicists. Feyerabend's pragmatic theory of observation focuses on the causal role of observation-sentences in the production and refutation of theories, reflecting his view that theory is meaningful independently of experience and that there is no principled semantic distinction between theoretical terms and observation terms.
1. The foundations of category theory are still being clarified, and there are ongoing efforts to develop a universe of higher-dimensional categories as a foundation for mathematics.
2. Jansana's work on selfextensional logics with conjunction and the deduction-detachment property for a single term is related to the field of mathematical logic and logical systems.
3. Model theory is connected to philosophy through the study of interpretation of formal and natural languages using set-theoretic structures, with Alfred Tarski’s truth definition serving as a model.
4. Topos theory was initially applied to set theory outside of algebraic geometry, including the investigation of models of various aspects of intuitionism and constructivism in mathematics.
5. Lawvere's Ph.D. thesis proposed the category of categories as a foundation for category theory, set theory, and thus the whole of mathematics, and used categories for the study of the logical aspects of mathematics.
6. Lewis modified the 1918 system of strict implication by replacing the stronger axiom with the weaker axiom in his 1920 work, titled "Strict Implication—An Emendation".
7. The Canberra Logic Group, with Sylvan as a key member, focused on pioneering research on relevant and paraconsistent logics, as well as applications to naïve set theory in the mid-1970s.
8. Christian Fermüller and George Metcalfe's work corresponds to optimal strategies in Giles’s game, and it has been extended by Fermüller &amp; Roschger in 2014 to characterize various types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers in fuzzy logic.
9. Categorical logic has shown its flexibility by modeling many surprising results of constructive and intuitionistic mathematics in a proper categorical setting, and by providing natural generalizations of standard set-theoretic notions from twentieth century logic.
10. Richard Montague is a pioneering figure in the study of the formal semantics of natural language through Church's type theory.
11. Ruth Barcan Marcus made a significant contribution in the field of modal logic in 1946 by formally extending the propositional system S2 of C. I. Lewis to include quantification, and developing it axiomatically in the style of Principia Mathematica. She also introduced the Barcan formula in its quantified form for the first time.
#### Summary:

* Joshua Cohen criticizes Pogge's analysis of poverty for being too simplistic and not adequately accounting for the complexity of poverty causation.
* One criticism of John Rawls' restriction of public reason is that it is too permissive about important matters of justice and fairness beyond constitutional essentials and basic justice.
* Gutmann argues that society cannot leave the education of future citizens to parents because democratic societies have the responsibility to educate all children for citizenship, and this education must cultivate democratic values.
#### Summary:

1. Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative value argue that the choice of reference class in legal factfinding is not straightforward and requires the exercise of judgment.
2. Learning that electrons are fundamental can assist in getting closer to the truth about fundamental particles by providing a piece of the complete truth, even though it is not the whole truth by itself.
John Salisbury describes the later practice of Epicureanism as the pursuit of sensual pleasure without bounds, which broke loose from the crucial restraint of moderation present in Epicurus' original philosophy. Epicureans attempted to reconcile freedom of the will with their belief in law-governed atoms by proposing that atoms can exhibit slight 'swerves' or departures from their usual paths, introducing indeterminism into their behavior and allowing room for freedom of the will. Lucretius believes it is acceptable to personify natural elements as gods only if one avoids the pernicious religious beliefs that such locutions imply.
1. The figure being referred to is simply "Figure 9," and its specific representation cannot be identified without additional context.
2. The dotted lines in the figure represent analogical arguments, which apply equally to deductive and inductive arguments.
3. Figure 3 is often used as a label for the diagram that illustrates the relationship between language, thought, and reality.
4. There is no specific philosophical concept or idea that is commonly referred to as "Figure 3.5."
5. In philosophical discussions, "Figure 1" often refers to the categorization of types of reasoning into deduction, induction, and abduction.
Giambattista della Porta had diverse scientific interests including physiognomies, astrology, ciphers, the art of memory, distillation, optics, magnetism, alchemy, cross-breeding, embellishment of (mostly female) bodies, and practical jokes. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim is associated with Aristotelianism in the Renaissance period. Zabarella did not consider Aristotle's works as a complete corpus to which nothing could be added. Pomponazzi rejected Averroes' view that the material intellect is one in number and shared by all humans. Vives believed that the senses provide the foundation for all knowledge, but they have limitations. Bruno considered the universe to be a more splendid and revelatory epiphany than Jesus Christ. Ramus was known as paginarius because he commented on the text page by page during lectures. Olivi argues that the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch, in contrast to Aristotle's view that the heart is the organ of the sense of touch.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, categorized into logic-justification, logic-massexpress, logic-free, logic-probability, bolzano, formal-epistemology, proof-theory, and logic-classical. The questions cover various topics such as provability in \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\), material conditional, substitution of terms, truth condition for negation, universally valid propositional form, epistemic necessity, subformulas in normal proofs, and formal entailment in deductive systems.
The capability approach is an open-ended normative framework that can host various theories and applications, with different structures, purposes, and normative commitments. Nussbaum's explanation of personal autonomy is similar to procedural accounts of autonomy, focusing on the procedures or processes that lead to autonomous actions or decisions. Claassen determines relevant capabilities for social justice by deriving them from society's ultimate concern with navigational agency. Starting a normative analysis from ends rather than means ensures that means are valued only instrumentally, based on their contribution to expanding people's capabilities.
1. Some physicists and philosophers of physics suggest that spacetime may not be fundamental in the context of their work on approaches to quantum gravity.
2. A useful description for a system of masses bound in orbit around a larger mass that can be treated as if it were isolated in certain conditions is George Smith's "quasi-insular system."
3. An acausal Malament-Hogarth spacetime is an example of a spacetime that is not causal, as described in Figure 2.3.1.
4. In Bell's analysis, there is no temporal order between spacelike separated events in relativistic spacetime because any system of coordinates will assign different time coordinates to such events, depending on the reference frame used.
1. The approach to democracy emphasizes striving for fundamental principles rather than treating it as an idealized set of institutions.
2. Countries and regions like Canada, Australia, Nepal, Ethiopia, several European states, and the European Union are facing dilemmas that have contributed to recent philosophical discussion about federalism.
3. The possibility of nations choosing to forget or embrace amnesia as a basis for political transition after a war is being suggested.
4. Making the operations of the school part of the curriculum and allowing students to participate in decision-making is a proposed solution for addressing issues in schools.
5. Central banks have contributed to financialization by encouraging its process within the economies of advanced industrial societies over recent decades.
6. Learning to talk and listen with other people about public problems is a potential key element of civic education in a deliberative democracy theory.
7. Social facts play a crucial role in pragmatic social science as they cannot be ignored when it comes to the realizability and feasibility of political ideals.
#### Summary:

1. The pragmatic approach to epistemology determines epistemic principles by identifying goals and empirically discovering which principles best serve those goals, such as having true beliefs or avoiding false ones.
2. Reflective equilibrium in moral deliberation involves working back and forth between judgments and principles, and can be narrow or wide in scope.
3. Muslim philosophers distinguish between hypotheses and postulates in the foundational principles of the demonstrative sciences based on the student's epistemic attitude towards them.
Summary:

* Schemmel argues that treating people as equals should be understood in terms of respectful relationships, not individual well-being.
* Tommie Shelby believes individuals have associative duties and solidarities towards their own communities in deeply unjust societies.
* Social freedom can only be experienced through relationships of mutual recognition in social endeavors.
* Enforcing a duty to provide personal relationship goods may be challenging due to potential violations of rights.
* Status-based rights are strongly held and robust because they are anchored in individual dignity.
* Limiting associative life can pursue values such as security, equality, and economic efficiency.
The Church-Turing thesis states that any well-defined procedure for manipulating symbols can be designed using a Turing machine. Gödel claims that the concept of computability is significant in epistemology because it provides an absolute definition of an interesting epistemological notion that does not depend on the formalism chosen. The Collected Works of A. M. Turing has 4 volumes. Turing's work during 1945-50 does not provide any evidence against Penrose's interpretation that physical effects could be uncomputable. Turing wrote a program for playing chess before there were computers to run such programs on. The simulation thesis is another common misconception that is often mistakenly associated with Turing's results in modern writing on computability and the brain. Gödel's proof contributes to computability theory by showcasing how to formalize the substitution of terms for free variables, leading to an effective form of Cantor's diagonal argument. Turing chose to focus on computable numbers in his paper because he found their technique to be less cumbersome compared to computable functions.
* Syntactic measures of simplicity can become independent of language choice through borrowing techniques from information theory.
* The insight that interprets \(- \log P(x\mid M)\) as the length of the optimal data-to-model code is known as the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle.
* The "excess in statistical significance" is the difference between the proportion of statistically significant results and the average statistical power, and can indicate bias in publishing statistically significant results.
* Statistics is considered by some to be non-inferential, contesting its association with ampliative and inductive inference.
* Statistical methods are key conduits between data and theory, and are crucial components of inferential reasoning.
* The IPCC has an "extremely likely" level of confidence that more than half of the increase in global mean surface temperature since 1950 is due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with a probability greater than 0.95.
1. There are no constraints on the data that can be put on S in the context of time travel and physics.
2. Rainville et al. used neutron capture reactions in their direct test of \(E = mc^2\) to compare the difference in rest-masses with the energy of emitted gamma rays.
3. Strictly monotonic transfer functions are less suitable for stabilizing neuronal assemblies because they do not regulate output, making it difficult to achieve a balanced operation.
4. Effective Field Theories (EFTs) in elementary particle physics are used to describe relevant phenomena in a certain energy domain and are inherently approximative, changing with the range of energy considered.
Summary:

* Endorsing a particular view on theory structure is logically and actually separable from positions on theory interpretation.
* Correspondence rules serve as the glue between theory and observation in scientific theories by providing observational interpretation of theoretical terms and connecting observation terms in the reduced theory to theoretical concepts in the reducing theory.
* Realists have attempted to explicate approximate truth in qualitative terms through the concept of limiting cases, where a theory may be considered more approximately true than one that preceded it if the earlier theory can be described as a limiting case of the later one.
1. Hypocritical blame is problematic because it distorts facts and impairs moral relationships, according to Scanlon.
2. Audi and Murphy argue that the term "integrity" is too vague and should be used with more specific moral terms.
3. When assessing collective responsibility, philosophers consider both positive and negative consequences.
4. Hanna Pickard suggests uncoupling responsibility from blame and connecting it with empathy in psychiatric ethics.
5. There is a philosophical dispute about whether finance professionals can be held morally responsible for systemic risk.
6. One issue in completing unfinished structures is discerning original design intent.
Ibn al-Haytham discussed undecidable problems in geometry and his work "Fī al-taḥlīl wa al-tarkīb" is considered mature in this area. The Arabic version of Ibn Rushd's work is not extant, but it has survived in a Hebrew translation. Joseph ben Judah Ibn ‘Aqnin was a Jewish scholar who used al-Farabi's works in his own writings.
The aggregation problem in deontological ethics refers to the challenge of determining whether moral catastrophes are really a million times more catastrophic than one death. The phrase 'impartial (or 'impersonal') point of view' is sometimes used interchangeably with 'moral point of view' to refer to the perspective from which moral judgments are made. Officials face a dilemma when deciding between a Cautionary Policy and a Covert Policy regarding hazardous waste management. Three options are suggested when faced with an impossibility theorem in population ethics: abandon some conditions, become moral sceptics, or explain away the significance of the proofs. The alternate account mentioned by Liberto tries to address the issue of whether future people have been 'unfairly' treated as compared against existing people and thus 'wrongfully exploited' in order to avoid objections to the rights-based approach in the nonidentity problem.
The first question is about the paratactic account of indirect speech reports, which is an account that holds the promise of overcoming Church's translation argument by using a demonstrative that refers to the utterance of the sentence that follows. The second question is about pragmatics, which is the field that focuses on specific instances of language use, as opposed to properties of types of expressions, and is sometimes characterized as dealing with the effects of context. The third question is about negative concord, which is a feature of many non-standard varieties of English, especially in informal speech and lyrics. The fourth question is about phrase structure rules in generative grammar, which describe the internal syntactic structures of sentence types by specifying how sentence symbols can be rewritten in terms of other symbols that correspond to noun phrases, verb phrases, and so on. The fifth question is about modal anaphora, which is also known as "deictic reference," where an expression's reference is determined by its context and the speaker's intention. The sixth question is about joke-telling and metaphor-making, which are activities that involve coordination with an audience according to Lewis (1979). The condition that must be met for this coordination to amount to communication is that either the audience must be able to identify what the speaker is doing, or the speaker must be able to identify what the audience is doing. The seventh question is about H's prior theory, which refers to how H is prepared in advance to interpret the expressions in S's utterance before it occurs. The eighth question is about the ideal situation of a language's being used according to its conventions, including implicit knowledge of L by its speakers, which Lewis calls a "perfect case of normal language use".
1. Dainton's early view suggests that time consciousness is dependent on the mode of judgment, with temporal differences being considered modes of judgments.
2. Reid views memory as an act of preservation through conception and belief of a past apprehension, without constituting an additional apprehension or current apprehension of past events.
3. Linguistic labels influence shape recognition in less than 100 milliseconds according to EEG and eye tracking studies.
4. There is a debate in the literature about whether tactile sensations should be distinguished from other types of sensations, such as thermal sensations.
5. The Cinematic form of realism explains the continuity of consciousness by positing that it is composed of a gap-free sequence of momentary or extremely brief states.
6. The temperature of our bodies can affect how we perceive the temperature of neutral water, with our awareness of temperature being subjective and depending on context and our body's thermal condition.
7. The phenomenon of illusory motion or the phi phenomenon refers to how still images can give rise to the experience of motion when displayed quickly in succession.
8. The view that thermal properties are secondary qualities suggests that temperature is not inherently "hot" or "cold," but rather that our awareness of temperature is subjective and depends on context and our body's thermal condition.
The text discusses Hugh Everett's proposal for solving the quantum measurement problem, focusing on his relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics quantum mechanics. It also mentions the "enlarged Hilbert space viewpoint" or "unitary embedding" claim regarding GRW-like models. The superposition principle and entanglement are major challenges in developing a coherent worldview that accommodates our knowledge of natural phenomena. The standard collapse theory is stochastic with fundamentally chance events, while pure wave mechanics is deterministic with no mention of probabilities in Everett's work.
Migration contributes to the genetic composition of a population by introducing genetically different individuals and plays an evolutionary role in limiting genetic divergence between subpopulations. Traditional methods for estimating heritability have limitations due to coarse-grained assumptions about genetic relatedness, but the discovery of DNA structure allowed for more refined estimation. Neutral genetic polymorphism was considered rare by the founders of ecological genetics due to the belief that recurrent mutation was unlikely and that it would take a long time for a neutral allele to reach appreciable frequency. If height is mostly influenced by environmental factors and heritability is low, then monozygotic twins will be as different in height from one another as dizygotic twins.
Condorcet's jury theorem is a mathematical result that suggests that larger groups are more likely to make accurate judgments when individual members have a better-than-chance probability of making correct judgments. The theorem assumes that individual judgments are better than random and stochastically independent. Deliberation can undermine the theorem's assumptions, and the theorem's conclusions are also known as "wisdom-of-crowds hypotheses." The theorem's importance for democratic theory was first affirmed by Brian Barry.
Summary:

* Viewing cancer as a necessary byproduct of aging raises questions about the evidence and validity of adaptationist explanations and challenges the traditional view of biological individuality and the role of the immune system in defining organismal boundaries.
* The passive vs. driven larger-scale trends in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory can be understood philosophically as either a distinction between trends generated by different causal mechanisms or as a distinction between different sorts of statistical phenomena, intersecting with philosophical disagreements about whether neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory is best understood as a causal theory or a statistical theory.
* It is unclear which causal factor(s) should figure centrally in classifying cancers because there could be hundreds or thousands of cancer types and subtypes depending on how fine-grained a characterization of the causal basis of cancer one adopts, and the classification of multifactorial diseases like cancer may not be univocal or reflect any inherent "naturalness."
* The immune processual point of view defines organismal persistence as "a coordinated group of changes" rather than as an invariant state or a continuous connection between such states.
Summary:

* Sapaṇ critiques the idea of ultimate reality being dedicated and the Dharmadhātu being a kind of "existent virtue," targeting those who consider virtue as self-established and eternal.
* According to the Stoics, anger is a desire that leads to action, tied to irrational behavior and involving judgments like 'He wronged me.'
* Robert Nozick's thought experiment, the "experience machine," explores the value of experiences, suggesting people would not choose to live in a machine that provides illusory but realistic experiences, as there is more value to life than just experiences.
The functional claim of genic pluralists is that genic selection models can represent any selective episode as well as hierarchical selection models. The Hagedoorns' "random sampling" describes a phenomenon where only a small fraction of a population successfully reproduces despite the size of the population remaining relatively constant. Population genetics has scarcely pursued Lewontin's program of focusing on selection coefficients for long segments of chromosomes, and Hayley Clatterbuck, Elliott Sober, and Richard Lewontin argue that it does not make sense to talk of drift dominating or being stronger than selection.
John Duns Scotus argues against the composition of a continuum out of indivisibles using a geometrical argument, stating that if the diagonal and side of a square were composed of points, they would be equal, violating Euclid's Book X. Abelard proposes an adverbial theory of thought instead of conformality and resemblance theories of intentionality. In Henry's theory of intellectual knowledge, the phantasm serves as the efficient cause and basis for abstraction, differing from Aquinas' standard doctrine.
Saadya was involved in a controversial Jewish calendrical reform during his rabbinic career. Maimonides might criticize Saadya's speculative theological reasoning as reasoning-in-the-service-of-pre-established-ideas. Gersonides believes that the quality of communications received depends on the constitutional perfection of the imaginative faculty. Polqar suggests that the Talmudic Sages included popular knowledge in their teachings to make it accessible to those with limited understanding.
1. Some theorists distinguish between public health and private health by considering who or what is promoting the health of the populace, with public health being the business of the public or government.
2. The commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics has been used by Buchanan and Ess in their works in 2008, 2009, and 2011, as well as by Ess and the Association of Internet Researchers in 2002.
3. In the Whitehall data, a mortality rate ratio of 1.0 indicates that the proportion of deaths in the professional/executive group is equal to the proportion of deaths in the reference group.
4. Section 2.6 of the text focuses on global justice considerations in relation to public health.
5. Google's Code of Conduct holds itself to a higher standard because it delivers "great products and services."
6. The principle of equality requires treating all individuals with equal respect and concern in the distribution of goods and opportunities.
7. The harm principle is a political and ethical principle which states that the only justification for restricting someone's liberty is to prevent harm to others. It is considered a compelling justification for public health policies that interfere with individual liberty.
Epistemic model of an extensive game is a tuple \(\langle W, \{\Pi_i\}_{i\in N}, \sigma\rangle \) where \(W\) is a set of states, \(\Pi_i\) is a partition on \(W\), and \(\sigma\) is a function assigning to each state \(w\), a strategy profile from the extensive game \(G\). The epistemic characterization results of ISDS and backward induction are historically and conceptually important in epistemic game theory. Iterated announcements in games can lead to self-refutation, and probabilities structure players' uncertainty in game theory. Strong Rationality is related to the rationalizability program for game solution and drives a game solution method. The central result of epistemic game theory highlights the importance of higher-order information by showing that rationality and common belief in rationality imply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.
#### Summary:

1. Combining a belief with the opposite of its conditional belief is called pairing a belief with the contrapositive of an instrumental belief.
2. Richard Jeffrey affirms credences while denying the existence of beliefs, while Richard Pettigrew also affirms credences but expresses sympathy towards denying the existence of beliefs.
3. A general principle connects prudential ends with beliefs and obligations, suggesting that if an individual has a prudential end and believes that 'p' is likely to help achieve that end, there is a prima facie obligation to believe that 'p'.
Population ecology considers deterministic and stochastic models, with stochastic models receiving more philosophical attention due to their interesting issues. Grantham views stochastic and deterministic explanations as complementary for understanding macro-level trends. Oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equations have not been achieved in organismal model systems without significant alterations until recently.
The paper discusses the relevance of relevance logic and suggests that S5 is the correct way to formulate a logic of necessity. Counterfactual logics and logics based on strict implication have different views on contraposition. Van Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and Pacuit (2009) have shown that dynamic-epistemic logics can be seen as decidable fragments of more expressive temporal logics. The article will first explain the connection between dialetheism and other related concepts such as trivialism and paraconsistency. Rahman and Rückert 2001 provide a dialogical semantical treatment of connexive logic. The algebraic fibring method developed by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro (1999) improved the versatility of logical techniques by introducing (universal) categorial constructions, which made it possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal logics.
#### Summary:

* Douglas Drabkin proposes that God undergoes a change from suffering to feeling joy as an expression of divine forgiveness.
* Process Theism expands on Anselm's and Aquinas' views on divine love by emphasizing sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the beloved.
* The combination of skeptical theism and the Moore Switch might best represent the religious tradition's emphasis on the mystery of why God allows evil.
* Philosophers of religion in the broadly Continental tradition may focus on the nature of evil rather than its challenges to theism, engaging with historical philosophical issues and complexities surrounding evil.
1. Gheaus raises a concern that Brighouse and Swift's account of parents' rights does not explain why biological parents have rights to rear their biological children rather than being redistributed to better prospective parents.
2. One potential issue with non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) becoming more routine is the affirmation of anti-disability bias and devaluation of disabled lives, particularly regarding Down Syndrome.
3. Some people may find it implausible that broad labor-based accounts of parenthood give the gestational mother veto power over other potential parents.
4. Violating research subjects' privacy or breaching confidentiality can result in serious harm to participants, such as the exposure of personal or sensitive information.
5. Offering substantial payments to research participants in lucrative studies can raise ethical concerns, such as whether payment is an appropriate response to participants' contributions and whether it could constitute undue inducement.
6. Establishing criteria for moral upgrades in the context of human enhancement can open a dilemma regarding whose account of virtues and sainthood should be followed.
7. Encryption might be necessary in research involving sensitive data, such as medical, sexual, and financial information, in order to protect the privacy and security of participants.
1. Category: evil
Question: Can a perfectly good being eliminate all evils if some evils are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them?
Answer: No, a perfectly good being cannot eliminate all evils if some evils are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them.
2. Category: evil
Question: How might the existence of necessary evils impact the strength of evidential formulations of the argument from evil against the existence of God?
Answer: If there can be evils that are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them, then the mere existence of evil—in the absence of further information—does not provide strong evidence against the existence of God, as it could be part of an overall greater good that is not immediately comprehensible to humans.
3. Category: perfectionism-moral
Question: How does one group of perfectionists define perfectionist goods?
Answer: One group of perfectionists, referred to as human nature perfectionists, define perfectionist goods as components of an excellent human life that relate to the development of human nature, such as the development of rationality which is essential to human nature.
4. Category: perfect-goodness
Question: What does 'perfect goodness' refer to when it is used to denote a specific perfection that an absolutely perfect being might have?
Answer: When 'perfect goodness' is used in this way, it refers to a particular way in which a thing can be great, and denotes the upper limit of greatness of that sort. It is often included in lists of the perfections exhibited by an absolutely perfect being, along with other perfections such as omniscience and omnipotence.
Philosophy of economics is the study of economic institutions, their constraints, and their implications for human welfare. Methodological individualism was designed to prevent the fallacy of ignoring collective action problems in social science. Milton Friedman's 1953 essay "The Methodology of Positive Economics" had a significant impact on economic methodology.
1. In the given statement, the question being asked in indirect form is "Do you know if she knows where she buried the treasure?"
2. Detective Brown's statement "The murderer of Smith is insane" poses a difficulty regarding truth or falsity when there is more than one murderer and they all belong to an evil cult, making it unclear which murderer he is referring to.
3. An example of a statement that might be made during a phone call where one person is trying to assure the other of their safety is "I do not believe that you are in danger."
4. An example of an expression that has extra sense attached to it that is not codifiable purely inferentially is the expression 'all', as it is used in inductive reasoning.
5. An example of a simple proposition involving the future is "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."
Leibowitz's definition of faith as almost synonymous with halakhic observance might create the appearance of paradox, as it could be difficult to identify the faith independently of this practice, making it seem like the practice constitutes the faith it is based on. Koons argues that the Persons of the Trinity are distinct objects by stating that each of them has the divine nature as its one metaphysical component and each has all the divine attributes. Furthermore, each Person is numerically distinct from each of the others according to Koons. Bishop and Evans agree that some version of fideism is justifiable on moral and/or rational grounds, but they disagree about whether what is believed by faith requires external evidential support. Specifically, Bishop and Evans dispute philosophical assumptions about belief entitlement. According to William Alston, faith commitment involves an active 'acceptance' rather than purely receptive belief, which can be understood as adopting a policy of deeming, positing, or postulating faith-claims as premises for decision-making, regardless of whether one feels assured of their truth. The firmness of faith commitment is then equivalent to the firmness of one's resolve to use faith-claims as a basis for thought, attitude, and behavior.
1. It can be challenging to provide a unified account of scientific method due to the wide variation in scientific activity across different disciplines, times, places, and individual scientists.
2. The multiplicity of complementary models is considered unproblematic in terms of producing reliable knowledge because they all provide useful information about the same features of the target system, even if different mathematical idealizations are used in their construction.
3. Generative justification complements consequential justification in science by providing an important form of justification that involves reasoning to a claim from data or previously established results more generally.
1. If an agent's beliefs are based solely on evidence, it could lead to contradictory beliefs and a lack of reasoning.
2. Self-deception paradox: If one is aware of their intention to deceive, it's difficult to be taken in by it, making self-deception impossible.
3. Claims about reasons can lead to paradoxical statements when the agent is mistaken about relevant beliefs.
4. CD normativism might require unguided formation of beliefs or intentional states, which could make the view surprising.
5. People might cope with toxin-type cases by engaging in self-deception or indulging in irrational fears or superstitions.
Inseparabilists and many Separabilists assume that evaluation contributes to semantic content, meaning that it plays a role in determining the reference or truth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms. Pragmatic Views suggest that thick terms aren't evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, but are only used evaluatively, while thin terms are evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions. The issue with detaching 'ought' in the debate about semantic obligations concerns whether the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way or implies a more disjunctive obligation.
Fry and Thompson's (1976) experiment using a different isotope of mercury and a tunable dye laser agreed well with quantum mechanical predictions and disagreed sharply with Bell’s Inequality. The experimental result in the Weihs et al. experiment is 30 standard deviations away from the upper limit of the CHSH inequality. Bell refers to the factorizability condition as the condition that the correlations be locally explicable, which has two components - that the correlations be explained, and not taken as primitive, and that the explanation be local. Two alternative approaches to achieving a detection loophole-free experiment that were explored historically involved K,B mesons and solid state systems. J. M. Jauch is credited with pointing out to Bell that Gleason's theorem implies a strengthening of von Neumann's result with the additivity requirement only for commuting observables. Bell explains that non-locality is derived in quantum mechanics through an EPR-type argument from a locality assumption and the perfect anticorrelations predicted by the considered quantum state. Einstein referred to separability and locality as "independent existence" in his arguments about the incompleteness of quantum theory.
Thomas Kuhn's conception of scientific revolutions is the most discussed account in the field of philosophy of science, known for his controversial claims about incommensurability, rationality, objectivity, progress, and realism. Kuhn introduces the concept of 'paradigm' as the set of beliefs, values, and practices that defines normal science. Kuhn argues that observation in science is influenced by prior beliefs and experiences, such that two scientists observing the same scene may not make the same theory-neutral observations. Milton Friedman emphasizes continuity in the context of scientific revolutions by highlighting the role of philosophical ideas that defenders of new viewpoints use to establish a kind of continuity after disruptive and incommensurable changes in constitutive principles.
In Hitchcock and Sober's example, Penny Predictor proposes her theory based on initial data and predicts accurately, while Annie Accommodator proposes her theory after having all data and accommodates it. Putnam believes the failure of his third thesis would lead to a "meta-induction". Peirce's Pragmatic Induction acknowledges success as a test for truth but notes that only a small portion of past theories have turned out to be true. Austin's correspondence theory defines truth in relation to facts, where a statement is true if it corresponds to a fact or situation. Michael Devitt claims an improvement over time in our success ratio for unobservables, challenging pessimistic arguments.
In the first question, the two basic operations on justification terms as introduced in Section 2.2 are \(\cdot\) and +. In the second question, the two particular truth degrees often assumed in many-valued logic are usually denoted by “0” and “1”, representing the traditional truth values “falsum” and “verum” respectively, or sometimes like “absolutely false” and “absolutely true”. In the third question, an example of an n-place function symbol in logic is the '+' sign, which is a two-place function symbol that combines with two singular terms to form a complex singular term that denotes the sum of the referents of those singular terms.
1. Compositionality requires a match between syntactic rules and semantic functions.
2. Simulators in Barsalou's theory generate inferences, combine recursively, and simulate perceptually.
3. Inquisitive question meanings define the meaning of a question in \(\Inq_B\).
4. Compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and constituents.
5. A directional semantics in argument systems has specific intersection and extension properties.
In Arendt's work, action is the activity most closely connected with natality as it allows individuals to re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their birth. Thinking, as described by Arendt, affects the process of judgment by loosening the grip of established criteria and values over the particular, preparing individuals to judge for themselves during times of historical crisis. Arendt was prompted to confront the challenge of human comprehension regarding atrocities after participating in Eichmann's trial, which made her grapple with understanding how an ordinary, law-abiding individual could commit such heinous crimes.
1. Belief is generally understood as a dispositional, affirmative attitude towards a proposition or state of affairs among analytic philosophers.
2. The functional role of knowledge is identified as closure of inquiry by Klemens Kappel, Christoph Kelp, and Patrick Rysiew.
3. Some philosophers consider epistemic norms to be categorical rather than instrumental imperatives due to their belief that these norms are set by our nature as knowledge-seeking beings.
4. A philosopher can examine which factors are relevant for knowledge without providing a full analysis of knowledge.
5. Explanatory talk is context-sensitive in two primary ways according to Greco's virtue contextualism: abnormal features tend to be explanatorily salient, and our interests and purposes single out certain features as especially relevant.
6. The procedures used in a courtroom to determine guilt do not apply to the process of forming rational beliefs in philosophy.
Locke's treatment of attention as a mode of thinking implies that once we have a theory of thinking, there is no need for further theory to account for attention, study, etc., as they can be considered modifications of thinking. Convention plays an additional role in using language to describe the colors of objects beyond merely observing similarity, according to Strawson. In exceptional cases when considering the act of story-telling, David Lewis suggests considering those possible worlds where the act of story-telling is genuinely what it claims to be in our world. The viewpoint expressed is that commonly used words have more value because they have survived the test of time and have been used by many generations, making them more likely to be sound and subtle than newly invented ones in ordinary and practical matters.
John Locke uses the phrase "imagine that" in his Essay to introduce hypothetical scenarios that help illustrate his philosophical points, often related to epistemology and human understanding. He defines personal identity over time in terms of consciousness and memory, arguing that personal identity is established by psychological continuity rather than physical continuity. A person, according to Locke, is a kind of being that has the capacity for self-reflective thought and can perceive itself as persisting over time. Adeofe uses the African, or Yoruba, conception of "person" to challenge Western philosophy’s treatment of persons and their persistence conditions. Locke argues that it is impossible for us to know if a quality or idea has a necessary connection with a real essence that we cannot conceive.
Free will theodicy argues that moral evil is our fault, not God's, because it is a result of our choices. FitzRalph believes that future actions cannot be necessarily determined by God's revelation of their consequences, as necessary actions would not be just or unjust. Anselm defines freedom as the power to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake, and argues that it is necessary and sufficient for justice and moral praiseworthiness.
Moore's statement suggests that there is no knowledge so certain that no reasonable person could doubt it. Moore believes that concepts must have independent existence for us to be acquainted with propositions. Boasanquet attributes the belief that there is no knowledge by acquaintance to Berkeley.
Bohr's correspondence principle explains why only certain spectral lines are observed in experiments. Bohr cautions against using confusing language in quantum theory and suggests that the physical reality of attributes like momentum and position must be questioned to address the issue of knowing both.
The explanatory ideal of ecology is having both a predictively accurate quantitative model and mechanisms incorporated in the model that have a clear and unambiguous biological interpretation. Kinji Imanishi is an ecologist and anthropologist who is considered the progenitor of the idea of animal culture and social transmission in animals. The Double Induction Method is a method proposed by Lloyd Morgan in his 1894 textbook that is used in the context of animal behavior analysis. Jared Diamond, May, Terborgh, Wilson & Willis were some of the conservation biologists who supported the idea of single large reserves being better than several small ones in the SLOSS debate.
The Vienna Circle was a group of philosophers and scientists who aimed to reconceptualize empiricism by interpreting recent advances in science. They sought to account for the presuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting them within a logical framework, making the role of conventions evident and denying the existence of any synthetic a priori principles. Members of the Berlin group never used the term 'positivism' about themselves. Kaufmann objected to the narrow strictures on the relation between the natural and the human sciences imposed by physicalism and instead defended a phenomenological sociology based on introspective experience. Reichenbach proposed replacing the criterion of strict verifiability with one demanding only that the degree of probability of meaningful statements be determinable in defense of empiricism. The Vienna Circle had international contacts and visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of analytical philosophers of science.
Abner of Burgos was a Jewish philosopher before converting to Christianity, Del Medigo followed Averroes' interpretation of Aristotelian principles in his exploration of human conjunction with the agent intellect, William needs to divide the intellect into active and passive parts to maintain internal consistency in his account of the intellect's generation of intelligible forms, and Henry of Ghent displayed a greater interest in skeptical problems than Siger.
#### Summary:

1. In Gilbert Ryle's philosophy, "I" refers to the same individual named by "Gilbert Ryle" when used by himself.
2. Ryle suggests that philosophers should study concepts by considering their practical uses and implications in context, rather than focusing on abstract nouns in isolation.
3. Ryle argues that both reductionist and duplicationist views of thought overlook the intention-to-find-out-what-happens-when, which is an essential aspect of experimental thinking.
4. In the context of moral epistemology, Jackson is the individual reaching a conclusion.
1. In the context of probabilistic independence, it is assumed that voters' opinions do not influence each other when determining correctness.
2. The Condorcet jury theorem describes a scenario where n voters must decide between two alternatives, only one of which is correct.
3. The primary concern regarding the mathematical analysis of social phenomena in voting methods is whether voting paradoxes are just theoretical constructs or if they reflect real-life phenomena in elections.
4. It is not possible to determine the exact number of votes candidate C won the election with based on the information provided.
5. Schwartz's Set Method is a voting system where each voter submits a ranking of candidates, and the winners are the smallest set of candidates that would not lose in a one-on-one election against any candidate outside of that set.
1. The centrality of philosophy in the Islamic intellectual constellation may have been influenced by its geographical and doctrinal peripheral status, as seen in Muslim Al-Andalus.
2. Mulla Sadra completed his major work, the Four Journeys (al-Asfar al-arba‘a), in Shiraz in 1038 AH/1628.
3. Publications about Philosophy in the Islamic world have been made in the area of studies referred to as "Philosophie in der islamischen Welt".
4. The two main questions debated among Muslim atomists concerning space were whether space is discrete or continuous, and whether there could be unoccupied space or interstitial void spaces between atoms, or if the cosmos is a plenum.
5. Possible routes of transmission of ancient Greek atomist theories to the Islamic Mutakallimun include doxographies, Galen's critiques, the Greek sceptical tradition, the supposed atomism of the Pythagorean Ecphantus, and a link to the Indian tradition.
Aristotle made a distinction between existence and essence in his works, Philoponus argued for creation out of nothing in his book On the Eternity of the World against Proclus, and Boethius distinguished between being good substantially and being good in that it exists.
1. Ontological naturalist views are problematic due to lack of clear definition, potential conflicts with scientific discoveries, and difficulty in accounting for normative domains.
2. Locke's appeal to 'life' does not eliminate the possibility of species divisions being concept-dependent and arbitrary conventions.
3. Processists fall into two camps: teleological/theological and naturalistic/secularist.
4. Eliminativists argue that racial categories are an illusion due to biological essentialism.
5. Contemporary process philosophers are divided over whether there is an issue being poorly conceived or approached in process philosophy.
6. Conway's metaphysics divides reality into three kinds of being called "species".
In Proclus' epistemology, discursive thought (dianoia) is responsible for understanding the causes of things, while opinion (doxa) only recognizes objects. In Proclus' hierarchy of the soul's faculties, opinion is the lowest level of rationality, above non-rational faculties like sense perception and imagination.
Burley believes that irrelevant propositions in an obligational disputation should not be answered based on their logical status but rather according to specific rules. Marsilius's solution to insolubles involves understanding propositions' material and formal significations, with affirmative propositions signifying that their subject and predicate supposit for the same thing, while negatives signify that they don't. Insolubles, like 'This proposition is false', falsify themselves due to self-contradiction.
1. Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics assign definite properties to quantum systems even when not being measured.
2. Quantum fields can be understood in terms of wave functionals that map classical field configurations to probability amplitudes.
3. The use of physical equivalence to show that unitarily inequivalent representations are not physically significant in quantum physics has been challenged.
4. The behavior of the energy gap is crucial for whether or not the quantum adiabatic algorithm can yield the desired "speed-up".
5. A state is defined as being decomposable or separable across algebras associated with regions in algebraic quantum field theory if its restriction to the algebra generated by those algebras is a product state.
6. The crucial axioms in Wightman's field axiomatics of Quantum Field Theory are covariance, microcausality, and spectrum condition.
7. There are no constraints on the data that can be put on S in the context of time travel and physics.
8. Rainville et al. used neutron capture reactions in their direct test of \(E = mc^2\) to compare the difference in rest-masses with the energy of emitted gamma rays.
9. Strictly monotonic transfer functions are less suitable for stabilizing neuronal assemblies because they do not regulate output, making it difficult to achieve a balanced operation.
The document discusses various philosophical concepts and theories, including Meinong's definition of word meanings, the existence of quantities, hylomorphism, the Port-Royal Grammar, Plato's Forms, and the hierarchy of being. It also covers ontological commitment, the truth of quantified propositions, Putnam's Division of Linguistic Labor, individual essences, and the concept of natural kinds. Additionally, the document touches on the grammatical similarity between terms, the possibility of disjoint things having identical locations, and the distinction between states of affairs based on ontological dependence.
1. Twisted self-deception involves believing something undesirable on weak evidence, while fiction can reveal genuine truths.
2. Manipulation bypasses rational deliberation, and deception can occur without the deceiver's belief in the truth of the false belief they cause.
3. Most children develop understanding of false belief after deception, knowledge acquisition, and desire, with happiness/existence in relation to false belief being the last to be understood.
4. Direct realism is the philosophical position that we directly apprehend the world of real things.
5. The dominant conception of perceptual contents is the conditions of accuracy associated with an experience.
6. The pragmatic approach to epistemology determines epistemic principles by identifying goals and empirically discovering which principles best serve those goals.
7. Belief is generally understood as a dispositional, affirmative attitude towards a proposition or state of affairs among analytic philosophers.

Additionally, it touches on the use of visual representations in mathematics, the definition of information, and the development of physics in the last third of the 20th century.
The document discusses various philosophers and their ideas on liberty, government, friendship, and marriage. It also mentions John Stuart Mill's views on pleasures, society, and education. Additionally, the document covers the views of other philosophers on virtues, morality, and knowledge.
1. Richard Price emphasizes the unique relationship between a promisor and a promisee, while Friedrich Hayek opposes centralized decisions on merit due to his abhorrence of central planning.
2. Holmes views tort law as primarily concerned with practical problem solving, and the main issue between legal moralists and proponents of public reason is whether legal justification should be steered towards citizens or moral truth.
3. Martha Nussbaum argues for domestic democratic endorsement as a condition of international law's legitimacy, while Berlin differentiated between two forms of 'political realism'.
4. Realists and neo-realists argue that states are the fundamental units of world politics and that power is the main currency of transnational interaction.
5. An egalitarian view can be formulated to demand equalizing the condition of all people living from now on, and successful anarchist campaigns of disobedience require organization and widespread participation.
1. Erin and Harris propose practical protections for organ donors and recipients when sales are legalized, such as adequate medical care and health checkups.
2. Patient-centered deontological theories focus on people's rights, with a core right against being used without consent.
3. Respecting the intimacy of medical experiences is required by sound ethics, recognizing associational privacy interests.
4. Coercion in organ sales can occur when a vendor charges someone in a situation where there is a duty to rescue.
5. The controversy regarding families' distress when organ donation is considered is the strength of their claim to avoid such distress.
6. An objection to taking organs without explicit consent is based on people's rights over their bodies and the duty of non-interference.
7. Payment for organ donation does not automatically invalidate consent, as it does not inherently mean that consent is not freely given.
Southern Song period political thinkers focused on character improvement for governance, influenced by historical context. Guo Xiang proposes "self-transformation" as an alternative to causal agents in explaining being's existence. Gongsun Long's main hypothesis is that language is a consecrated structure that denominates actualities. Laozi suggests non-linguistic introspection as an alternative to linguistic comprehension to preserve naturalness. The Han shu Bibliographic Treatise includes "Recipes for Married Women and Infants" in its "Classical Recipes" section.
The document discusses various philosophical aspects of science, including the role of laws, the utility of mathematics, and the concept of realism. It also mentions specific scientists and their theories, such as Einstein, Weyl, and Eddington, and their contributions to the field. The document also touches on the concept of causality and the relativity principle, and the importance of homogeneity and isotropy in physical space.
Beauvoir argues that prioritizing the future over the present can lead to sacrificing the present and result in injustices. The erotic experience reveals human beings' ambiguous condition as both flesh and spirit, and as the other and subject. Matricide is necessary for subjectivity to be achieved, according to Kristeva. Freudianism's cultural impact and theoretical power make it difficult to dismiss claims of its scientific validity. In the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a sexual position by submitting to castration and entering into signification. Judith Butler argues that gender is performative and constituted through the repetition of stylized acts. Lacan views the Oedipal personas as socio-cultural roles that can be played by any number of possible persons of various sexes/genders. Freud argued that dreams and waking life are similar in the context of psychoanalytic theory.

Vattimo proposes that overcoming modernity must be understood as Verwindung, which involves twisting or distorting modernity itself instead of progressing beyond it, in Nietzsche and Heidegger's shared view. Nishida refers to the "self-identity of contradictories" as a totality that holds together differences without sublating them into a higher unity. Diderot's Supplément au voyage de Bougainville anticipates the figure of the native ethnographer and generates universal cultural understandings by comparatively examining the foundations of morality and civilization in both Tahitian and European cultures. Watsuji understands 'climate' in a broad sense as not only referring to the natural environment of a given land, but also as encompassing the social environment. Nishida Kitarō is the philosopher associated with the concept of "nothingness" in Japanese Philosophy. A charitable reading of Nishida’s statements on the special place of Japan interprets them as advocating that his country overcome its outdated vision of itself as a colonizing nation, and embrace a global conception of itself as a nation interacting with other nations in a world of mutually defining equals. Ideas that have specific cultural origins can be critically and creatively taken up and developed into more universally viable forms through intercultural dialogue.

Theodor Adorno believes art should denounce injustice, not distract with beauty. Kant suggests imagination and understanding harmonize in aesthetic experience. Reiter and Geiger propose the concept of an "aesthetic normal idea" to understand Kant's theory. Benjamin's work reveals the relationship between Romantic aesthetics and history. Kant suggests a feeling of a supersensible faculty is awakened when we become aware of the inadequacy of our sensible faculties.

Existentialism emphasizes human freedom and the power of human will. Authenticity refers to engaging in one's projects as one's own. Sartre's critique of reflection forms the basis of his argument for pre-reflective consciousness. Camus's solution to the problem of suicide is to embrace life fully with consciousness. Heidegger saw traditional Christianity as making authentic existence more difficult.

Foucault critiques the view on sexuality in the 1960s and 1970s, Lyotard claims that trying to control and prefigure future events is an attempt to escape time, Lamarque claims that the reading practices of literary critics and historians involve different normative practices, Henry claims that the dominating feature of contemporary culture is the triumph of Galilean science and its technological developments, Lyotard never argued that all was socially constructed or that all language games had equal validity, and Bourdieu (1972) claims that social practice is generated by a "habitus," which is a mentally internalized system of discrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions.

In Arendt's work, action is the activity most closely connected with natality as it allows individuals to re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their birth. Thinking, as described by Arendt, affects the process of judgment by loosening the grip of established criteria and values over the particular, preparing individuals to judge for themselves during times of historical crisis.

23. From Barwise's result, an inference rule can be obtained to justify hypotheses based on their explanatory power.
24. According to a default theory, if we can nonvacuously close a stage under an applicable default, we should do so; otherwise, we do nothing.
25. The AGM system lacks the ability to include conditional beliefs, which prevents it from explaining the logical relationships between conditional defaults.

27. In Conway's Game of Life, a glider is a pattern that remains unchanged through generations of development.
28. The observed direction of time is referred to as "the arrow of time".

35. Dialetheism is the view that true contradictions can exist, challenging the principle of non-contradiction in classical logic, and it has implications for the understanding of negation in logic.
36. The logical statement expressed in the sentence "c ∈ C ↔ c ∉ C" is "c is an element of set C if and only if c is not an element of set C".

3. Each leaf in a winning P strategy for a given formula in the game is labeled with a P elementary statement.
4. If Duplicator has a winning strategy in the pebble game, it means the two structures agree for sentences using at most p variables.
5. The smoothness condition is similar to condition (L) from section 3.2.1, but it is used to make classical entailment compatible with defeasibility or nonmonotonicity in a model.

* Cosmological argument: One possible explanation for the existence of particular finite beings is that they exist because of their causes, leading back to the beginning of the universe or a supernatural being.
* Teleological arguments: An engraved sentence provides stronger evidence of intentional design than mere complexity in an artifact.
* Philosophy of religion: Some argue that the cosmos as a whole needs an explanation even if everything in it can be explained through infinite regress.
* Leibniz's evil: Some atheists and Socinians characterize the existence of God as an underachievement given the state of the world we live in.
* Wodeham: Denying the existence of a first, uncaused cause would result in an infinite series of caused causes without a terminating point.
* Life meaning: Some argue that an afterlife is necessary for life to be meaningful because justice is necessary for a meaningful life and can only be achieved in an afterlife.
* Natural theology: Some philosophers argue that no presumption of metaphysical possibility is justified, especially regarding supersensible things.
* Suarez: The nature of final causation was relatively unknown to ancient philosophers because it is more obscure and was not inquired into as thoroughly as other types of causes.

1. Skeptical theism requires adding a lemma stating that we have no reason to think that the cases we do not see (noseeums) are not representative of reality.
2. Nozick must deny closure across simplification to maintain his rejection of K and his acceptance of closure across equivalence.
3. Process reliabilism claims a high correlation between process-reliability and justified belief, and between process-unreliability and unjustifiedness.
4. The three main views about the nature of a priori justification are that it is not significantly different from empirical justification, that it rests on a distinct type of internal mental state called rational intuition or rational insight, and that a person can be a priori entitled to believe certain propositions independently of any evidence.
5. In the doctrine of eternal origination, cause and effect is viewed as a relationship between a mover and a moved object.
6. The expectation expressed is that consuming product P will result in the production of Q.--- --- 
 --- --- The purpose of using inductive argument (S) is to provide support for the claim that the Uniformity Principle will continue to work in the future, based on the success of past instances of arguments that relied upon it. Nelson Goodman proposes that we should justify rules of inductive logic by bringing them into reflective equilibrium with what we judge to be acceptable inferences in a broad range of particular cases. Spohn's ranking-theoretic approach to causation addresses scenarios of overdetermination in a way that is similar to probabilistic accounts of this type of causal situation. One possible way to address pseudo-overdetermination in Swain's theory is by specifying the types of changes in one's epistemic situation that are consistent with it, and then ruling out any additional unwarranted inferences as inconsistent with such changes.--- --- 
 --- --- Empirically-minded critics argue that traditional virtues may not be realistic for most people's development. Armstrong addresses the issue of what the lawmaking relation is in response to van Fraassen regarding laws of nature. Goddard and Routley criticize philosophers who are too hasty in labeling statements as gibberish or ungrammatical without proper justification. Strauss argues that philosophy cannot refute or confirm belief in revelation because they rely on different modes of understanding. Assumptions introduced as hypotheses at the discovery level serve as a wager that is tested in the context of justification.--- --- 
 --- --- The second axiom states that as long as an agent possibly intends an action, it is not able to uncommit to it. A doing (or an attempt to do) B is generated by a practical principle at time t if the agent does not change their mind. According to the narrower understanding of practical reasoning, it is an inferential process that modifies our beliefs, including our normative beliefs about what we ought to do. The adjustments in our intentions that result from such reflection are not themselves conclusions of reasoning. Once an agent has figured out what one ought to do, there is no further practical reasoning left to be done on this view. According to Donald Davidson in his 1963 paper, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," a reason is characterized as an attitude of an agent that can be cited to explain or justify an action. According to the Davidson/Anscombe thesis, the agent's act of moving his leg = his act of trying to move that leg. So, perhaps the act of trying to move the leg doesn't cause the act of moving after all, since they are just the same.--- --- 
 --- --- The Analysis debate suggests modifying the concept of truth conduciveness to consider all relevant evidence. Transmission failure occurs when evidence for a proposition cannot be transmitted to certain elements of collateral information. A deductively valid argument has the power to resolve doubt about its conclusion. An alternative strategy for solving McKinsey paradox assumes a different presupposition of s's cognitive project. Young children cannot be justified in accepting their parents' testimony according to Local Reductionism. A preliminary suggestion for restricting necessary truths is that P entails* Q only if the fact that would make P true is at least a constituent of the fact that would make Q true. The complexity of relationships between evidence can lead to fallibility in responding appropriately to evidence. The proposed source of infallibility in foundational justification is a special kind of justification where the belief's ground or justification entails the truth of the belief.--- --- 
 --- --- In non-zero-sum games, not all Nash equilibria may be plausible solutions due to the existence of multiple equilibria. Best responses and Nash equilibria can be characterized using hybrid logic in game theory. The endogenous correlated equilibrium concept is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium concept in the 2-agent case. A group of strategies is in a Nash equilibrium when each agent's strategy is a best-response to the strategies chosen by the other players.--- --- 
 --- --- Adams's result implies that deductive reasoning is validated even with uncertain premises if they are not too uncertain and there are not too many of them. Direct inference is one of the forms of inference mentioned by Jevons, which involves applying the substitution of similars to certain premises in order to arrive at logical conclusions. Abduction is not necessarily a sufficient condition for justifying hypotheses, and restricting analogical reasoning to only conform to simple formal schema can allow inferences that should not be considered valid. Meiland uses the example of gravity and the laws of planetary motion to illustrate how abduction can be used to justify hypotheses.--- --- 
 --- --- Inseparabilists and many Separabilists assume that evaluation contributes to semantic content, meaning that it plays a role in determining the reference or truth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms. Pragmatic Views suggest that thick terms aren't evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, but are only used evaluatively, while thin terms are evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions. The issue with detaching 'ought' in the debate about semantic obligations concerns whether the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way or implies a more disjunctive obligation.--- --- 
 --- --- Locke's treatment of attention as a mode of thinking implies that once we have a theory of thinking, there is no need for further theory to account for attention, study, etc., as they can be considered modifications of thinking. Convention plays an additional role in using language to describe the colors of objects beyond merely observing similarity, according to Strawson. In exceptional cases when considering the act of story-telling, David Lewis suggests considering those possible worlds where the act of story-telling is genuinely what it claims to be in our world. The viewpoint expressed is that commonly used words have more value because they have survived the test of time and have been used by many generations, making them more likely to be sound and subtle than newly invented ones in ordinary and practical matters.

9. In Gilbert Ryle's philosophy, "I" refers to the same individual named by "Gilbert Ryle" when used by himself, and Ryle suggests studying concepts by considering their practical uses and implications in context.
1. Buddhist societies might be reluctant to prohibit abortion due to historical advocacy of religious toleration, potential difficulty and cost of enforcement, potential alienation of people, and the karmic cost of imposing laws.
2. It is challenging to accept the idea of structure without embracing at least part of correlation because structure reflects a deeper level of correspondence that builds upon the surface-level relationships represented by correlation.
3. The age difference between a clone and her progenitor could make it easier for the clone to view herself as distinct from the progenitor than if she had been genetically identical to someone her same age.
4. The difference in how we relate to ourselves compared to how we relate to others might stem from the fact that our actions towards ourselves and others can feel different, even if they share similar moral implications.
5. There might be no need to explain why it is wrong to consume wrongfully produced food if the statement is self-evident or widely accepted as true, or if there is a lack of consensus or understanding about what constitutes wrongful food production.
6. The second and third views being referred to are likely forms of egoism where the egoist is not the sole intended beneficiary of morality, but without additional context it is difficult to be more specific about what these views might be.

22. Śāntideva discusses two kinds of human beings in his chapter on wisdom: ordinary people and meditators.
23. Bhāvavevika's third etymological sense of paramārtha identifies it with cognition that accords with the knowledge of ultimate truth, and such cognition has emptiness as its object and serves as a means through which one develops non-conceptual knowledge of ultimate reality.
24. Candrakīrti's argument from emptiness reveals the unreality of conventionally real phenomena by appealing to causal processes at work in producing these entities.
25. The objector argues that Vasubandhu's reinterpretation of scripture concerning the sense bases is not satisfactory, as it does not refute the direct reading of scripture that affirms the ultimate reality of such entities.

10. The first valid mood in syllogistic logic that involves an A proposition followed by another A or I proposition, which results in an A proposition, is called Barbara.
11. Aristotle's syllogisms primarily focus on arguments with exactly two premises, but longer arguments can be formed by chaining together smaller arguments.
12. When inferring from a universal statement to singular terms, an issue arises when one uses singular terms that may not be of the correct type, leading to potential fallacious inferences.
13. The potential error or risk of going wrong in an argument comes from the premises rather than the reasoning, as long as the reasoning follows correctly from the premises without making any additional assumptions.
14. Informal logics can use acceptability as a criterion instead of truth when judging premises in certain contexts.
15. Lakatos calls the development where many philosophers started to agree on certain foundationalist ideas "empiricism" or "quasi-empiricism".
16. Carnap's later work, "The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories", developed linguistic frameworks that included probabilistic relations and formed the basis of decision theory.
17. Carnap is extremely permissive in his attitude towards mathematics, accepting essentially all mathematical systems as equally valid.
18. Carnap does not claim that scientific laws are unified or that they are not, leaving it as an empirical question.
19. Carnap's theory is of the descriptivist type, as it does not require any causal elements in its Pythagorean empiricism.
20. Carnap's approach to dispositional predicates was problematic for many philosophers because it did not allow for their complete elimination from the language in certain cases.
21. Feyerabend's unconventional teaching methods at Berkeley led to some trouble, such as regularly canceling lectures and not being adequately prepared.
22. His fellow science students initially viewed Ehrenhaft's work during the 1949 Alpbach seminar as fraudulent, but later realized the nature of scientific rationality after witnessing Ehrenhaft's battle with orthodox physicists.
23. Feyerabend's pragmatic theory of observation focuses on the causal role of observation-sentences in the production and refutation of theories, reflecting his view that theory is meaningful independently of experience and that there is no principled semantic distinction between theoretical terms and observation terms.
24. The foundations of category theory are still being clarified, and there are ongoing efforts to develop a universe of higher-dimensional categories as a foundation for mathematics.
25. Jansana's work on selfextensional logics with conjunction and the deduction-detachment property for a single term is related to the field of mathematical logic and logical systems.
26. Model theory is connected to philosophy through the study of interpretation of formal and natural languages using set-theoretic structures, with Alfred Tarski’s truth definition serving as a model.
27. Topos theory was initially applied to set theory outside of algebraic geometry, including the investigation of models of various aspects of intuitionism and constructivism in mathematics.
28. Lawvere's Ph.D. thesis proposed the category of categories as a foundation for category theory, set theory, and thus the whole of mathematics, and used categories for the study of the logical aspects of mathematics.
29. Lewis modified the 1918 system of strict implication by replacing the stronger axiom with the weaker axiom in his 1920 work, titled "Strict Implication—An Emendation".
30. The Canberra Logic Group, with Sylvan as a key member, focused on pioneering research on relevant and paraconsistent logics, as well as applications to naïve set theory in the mid-1970s.

1. Hermann Weyl believed that mathematics should be extended to include notions beyond intuition only if they play an indispensable role in the physical sciences.
2. Brumfiel did not use the transfer principle in his method of proof, but the text does not provide an explicit reason for this decision.
3. Wittgenstein would likely argue that P, as a syntactically independent expression, is not a proposition of PM and has no useful purpose beyond performing "bits of legerdemain."
4. Hilbert's foundational book, "Grundlagen der Geometrie," laid the groundwork for the central foundational problems of mathematics in the early 20th century.
5. The truths of Euclidean geometry were not subject to Frege's doctrine of logicism because he considered them to be synthetic a priori and founded in a different way from the truths of arithmetic.
6. Weyl criticized Hilbert's project as replacing contentual mathematics by a meaningless game of formulas and suggested that consistency of a formal system of mathematics is not enough to believe in the truth of the pre-formal mathematics it codifies.
7. Hermann Weyl may have become disenchanted with intuitionism in mathematics due to the mathematical sacrifices required by the strict adherence to intuitionistic doctrine.
8. It is coherent to maintain that mathematics is the science of formal systems even after the incompleteness theorems were proven.
9. Detlefsen argues that Hilbertian instrumentalism only requires real-soundness, which means that ideal mathematics must not prove anything that conflicts with real mathematics.
10. Wittgenstein argues that infinite sets are not extensions and that it is not possible to prove that one infinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set.

The document contains information about various philosophers and their contributions to philosophy, including their views on skepticism, cognition, and metaphysics. It also mentions the influence of certain philosophers on others and the impact of certain events on philosophical thought.
Stoicism emphasizes living virtuously and in accordance with moral duty, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the welfare of all humans. The Stoic sage has an unconditional desire to live virtuously and views virtue as sufficient for happiness. In the Hellenistic culture of Ancient Greece, striving for perfection in body and mind through sport played a major role in society. Aristotle and ancient philosophers believe that nothing comes to be out of nothing. Zeno argues that if every space is infinitely divisible, then any moving object must traverse an infinite number of smaller spaces to cover the distance, making local motion impossible. In Proclus' epistemology, discursive thought is responsible for understanding the causes of things, while opinion only recognizes objects.
The document contains a collection of question-and-answer pairs about philosophy, covering various topics such as double-consciousness, Frantz Fanon's focus on Africa, Thomas Jefferson's passion for learning, Fanon's concept of the inferiority complex, Locke's views on young artists, Noah Webster's contributions to education, Crummell's early thinking about morality and language, Locke's philosophy on God and angels, Hume's differing views from Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley, Edwards' defense of the objectivity of the new spiritual sense, disagreement among scholars about Locke's beliefs, Berkeley's argument against material objects, similar developments towards a theory of consciousness in England, Locke's argument about the connection between qualities and real essences, Philonous' claim about the existence of ideas, Descartes and Locke's realist position on external objects, Berkeley and Hume's skepticism, Condillac's thought experiments, Scudéry's dialogues, Descartes' lasting impact, Desgabets' loyalty to some aspects of Cartesian philosophy, Mersenne's categorization of metaphysics, Leibniz's metaphor for the mind, his commitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, his view on intuitive knowledge, his proposal to explain physical extension in terms of solidity, Malebranche's claim about the need for a general and confused apprehension of an object, Locke's conclusion about preferring an action, Leibniz's illustration of postponing willing an action, Molyneux's urging Locke to write a moral treatise, Locke's discussion of free will and voluntary action, Mary Astell's feminist philosophy, Locke's belief about the intrinsic value of things, Jonathan Edwards' belief about corporeal things, Margaret Fell's urging to examine scriptures, Margaret Cavendish's belief about God's immateriality, Astell's arguments about the mind and body, and the mind's consciousness of its striving.
Auguste Comte is known as the founder of positivism and developed the "law of three stages" theory of social development. St. Augustine considered lust within marriage as a venial sin and offered the first justification of the Christian prohibition on suicide. Iamblichus' philosophy system is a more intricate and detailed version of Plotinus', incorporating elements from Plotinus' Enneads and the teachings of Porphyry. Boethius argued that God's foreknowledge is consistent with human free will, while Aquinas believed that if God foreknows an event, it is necessary and unchangeable. Luis de Molina introduced the concept of middle knowledge as part of the debate about free will and God's knowledge.
Spinoza's philosophy is discussed in various aspects, including his relationship with Henry More, his views on freedom and toleration, his interpretation of 'good' and 'evil', and his account of causation. René Descartes is a philosopher and mathematician known for his statement "Cogito, ergo sum" and his method of skepticism. Descartes' account of clear and distinct perceptions, according to Astell, requires ideas to be clear in order to provide knowledge. Kant argues that Spinoza conflates the notion of a being that is not grounded in or caused by anything more fundamental with the notion of a being that does not inhere in anything more fundamental in his definition of substance. Oresme's theory of motion is called the condicio-theory of accidents, which is an application of his more general theory of accidents to the problem of motion. John Locke uses the phrase "imagine that" in his Essay to introduce hypothetical scenarios that help illustrate his philosophical points, often related to epistemology and human understanding.

7. Consuming wrongfully-produced goods is wrong due to cooperation with wrongdoing.
8. The contractual view conflicts with common-sense intuitions of family morality.
9. The social model of disability views disability as a result of societal barriers.

1. Economic Justice: Utilitarian social welfare functions have been analyzed for their properties, applied to other domains, and computational tools have been developed.
2. Legal-Econ Analysis: Cost-benefit analysis aims to fulfill the Kaldor-Hicks criterion by ensuring a Pareto preferred distribution of goods.
3. Economics: Many economists assume preferences align with welfare, given self-interest and good judgment.
4. Methodological Individualism: Elster assumes rational choice theory follows from methodological individualism.
5. Preferences: The standard discounted utility model doesn't fully represent human behavior, but can be addressed with a bifactorial model or hyperbolic discounting.
6. Public Goods: The Groves-Clarke mechanism is expensive but avoids social waste compared to alternative mechanisms.
7. Preferences: Numerical representation of preferences has limitations, as not all preferences can be represented numerically.

Technological progress often occurs through innovations that lower transaction costs, such as transportation and communication advancements, as well as innovative organizational structures and business models. Adam Smith's invisible hand argument suggests that individuals pursuing their own interests can lead to positive outcomes for society through competition and innovation.

Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem in social choice theory explores the consequences of rationality and ethical constraints in forming social preferences, proving that no method can satisfy certain conditions. Allais' paradox in decision theory involves preferences between risky prospects, discovered by Maurice Allais. Philosophy of economics is the study of economic institutions, their constraints, and their implications for human welfare. Methodological individualism was designed to prevent the fallacy of ignoring collective action problems in social science. Milton Friedman's 1953 essay "The Methodology of Positive Economics" had a significant impact on economic methodology.

In the context of probabilistic independence, it is assumed that voters' opinions do not influence each other when determining correctness. The Condorcet jury theorem describes a scenario where n voters must decide between two alternatives, only one of which is correct. The primary concern regarding the mathematical analysis of social phenomena in voting methods is whether voting paradoxes are just theoretical constructs or if they reflect real-life phenomena in elections. It is not possible to determine the exact number of votes candidate C won the election with based on the information provided. Schwartz's Set Method is a voting system where each voter submits a ranking of candidates, and the winners are the smallest set of candidates that would not lose in a one-on-one election against any candidate outside of that set.

14. Strawson suggests that a bare particular or substratum is needed to avoid an infinite regress of relata in the instancing relation.
15. The fundamental difference between specific qualia and determinate physical qualities is not about the material for error, but about the types of mistakes we can make about their causes.
16. A substance-attribute view distinguishes things and properties, even if they are intimately connected.
17. Rule 250 in ontology states that whatever is present when something begins is necessarily part of the thing's nature.
